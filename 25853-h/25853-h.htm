<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>This</span> was a very full year in many ways. In February, Charles
Dickens obtained possession of Gad's Hill, and was able to
turn workmen into it. In April he stayed, with his wife and
sister-in-law, for a week or two at Wate's Hotel, Gravesend,
to be at hand to superintend the beginning of his alterations
of the house, and from thence we give a letter to Lord
Carlisle. He removed his family, for a summer residence in
the house, in June; and he finished "Little Dorrit" there
early in the summer. One of his first visitors at Gad's Hill
was the famous writer, Hans Christian Andersen. In January
"The Frozen Deep" had been played at the Tavistock House
theatre with such great success, that it was necessary to
repeat it several times, and the theatre was finally demolished
at the end of that month. In June Charles Dickens heard,
with great grief, of the death of his dear friend Douglas
Jerrold; and as a testimony of admiration for his genius
and affectionate regard for himself, it was decided to
organise, under the management of Charles Dickens, a
series of entertainments, "in memory of the late Douglas
Jerrold," the fund produced by them (a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sum) to be presented to Mr. Jerrold's family. The amateur
company, including many of Mr. Jerrold's colleagues on
"Punch," gave subscription performances of "The Frozen
Deep;" the Gallery of Illustration, in Regent Street, being
engaged for the purpose. Charles Dickens gave two readings
at St. Martin's Hall of "The Christmas Carol" (to such
immense audiences and with such success, that the idea of
giving public readings for his <i>own</i> benefit first occurred to
him at this time). The professional actors, among them
the famous veteran actor, Mr. T. P. Cooke, gave a performance
of Mr. Jerrold's plays of "The Rent Day" and "Black-eyed
Susan," in which Mr. T. P. Cooke sustained the
character in which he had originally made such great success
when the play was written. A lecture was given by Mr.
Thackeray, and another by Mr. W. H. Russell. Finally,
the Queen having expressed a desire to see the play, which
had been much talked of during that season, there was
another performance before her Majesty and the Prince
Consort at the Gallery of Illustration in July, and at the
end of that month Charles Dickens read his "Carol" in the
Free Trade Hall, at Manchester. And to wind up the
"Memorial Fund" entertainments, "The Frozen Deep"
was played again at Manchester, also in the great Free
Trade Hall, at the end of August. For the business of
these entertainments he secured the assistance of Mr. Arthur
Smith, of whom he writes to Mr. Forster, at this time: "I
have got hold of Arthur Smith, as the best man of business
I know, and go to work with him to-morrow morning."
And when he began his own public readings, both in town
and country, he felt himself most fortunate in having the
co-operation of this invaluable man of business, and also of
his zealous friendship and pleasant companionship.</div>

<p>In July, his second son, Walter Landor, went to India
as a cadet in the "Company's service," from which he was
afterwards transferred to the 42nd Royal Highlanders. His
father and his elder brother went to see him off, to Southampton.
From this place Charles Dickens writes to Mr.
Edmund Yates, a young man in whom he had been interested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from his boyhood, both for the sake of his parents
and for his own sake, and for whom he had always an
affectionate regard.</p>

<p>In September he made a short tour in the North of
England, with Mr. Wilkie Collins, out of which arose the
"Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices," written by them
jointly, and published in "Household Words." Some
letters to his sister-in-law during this expedition are given
here, parts of which (as is the case with many letters to his
eldest daughter and his sister-in-law) have been published
in Mr. Forster's book.</p>

<p>The letters which follow are almost all on the various
subjects mentioned in our notes, and need little explanation.</p>

<p>His letter to Mr. Procter makes allusion to a legacy lately
left to that friend.</p>

<p>The letters to Mr. Dilke, the original and much-respected
editor of "The Athen&aelig;um," and to Mr. Forster, on the subject
of the "Literary Fund," refer, as the letters indicate,
to a battle which they were carrying on together with that
institution.</p>

<p>A letter to Mr. Frank Stone is an instance of his kind,
patient, and judicious criticism of a young writer, and the
letter which follows it shows how thoroughly it was understood
and how perfectly appreciated by the authoress of
the "Notes" referred to. Another instance of the same
kind criticism is given in a second letter this year to
Mr. Edmund Yates.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Procter</span>,</div>

<p>I have to thank you for a delightful book, which has
given me unusual pleasure. My delight in it has been a
little dashed by certain farewell verses, but I have made up
my mind (and you have no idea of the obstinacy of my
character) not to believe them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it is not taking a liberty&mdash;perhaps it is&mdash;to
congratulate you on Kenyon's remembrance. Either way I
can't help doing it with all my heart, for I know no man
in the world (myself excepted) to whom I would rather the
money went.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Affectionately yours ever.<br />

<div class="sidenote">Sir James
Emerson
Tennent.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Tavistock House</span>, <i>January 9th, 1857.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Tennent</span>,</div>

<p>I must thank you for your earnest and affectionate
letter. It has given me the greatest pleasure, mixing the
play in my mind confusedly and delightfully with Pisa, the
Valetta, Naples, Herculan&aelig;um&mdash;God knows what not.</p>

<p>As to the play itself; when it is made as good as my
care can make it, I derive a strange feeling out of it, like
writing a book in company; a satisfaction of a most
singular kind, which has no exact parallel in my life; a
something that I suppose to belong to the life of a labourer
in art alone, and which has to me a conviction of its being
actual truth without its pain, that I never could adequately
state if I were to try never so hard.</p>

<p>You touch so kindly and feelingly on the pleasure such
little pains give, that I feel quite sorry you have never seen
this drama in progress during the last ten weeks here.
Every Monday and Friday evening during that time we
have been at work upon it. I assure you it has been a
remarkable lesson to my young people in patience, perseverance,
punctuality, and order; and, best of all, in that
kind of humility which is got from the earned knowledge
that whatever the right hand finds to do must be done with
the heart in it, and in a desperate earnest.</p>

<p>When I changed my dress last night (though I did it
very quickly), I was vexed to find you gone. I wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to have secured you for our green-room supper, which was
very pleasant. If by any accident you should be free next
Wednesday night (our last), pray come to that green-room
supper. It would give me cordial pleasure to have you
there.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Ever, my dear Tennent, very heartily yours.<br />
</div>


<div class="sidenote">M. de
Cerjat.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Tavistock House</span>, <i>Monday Night, Jan. 17th, 1857.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>So wonderfully do good (epistolary) intentions become
confounded with bad execution, that I assure you I laboured
under a perfect and most comfortable conviction that I had
answered your Christmas Eve letter of 1855. More than
that, in spite of your assertions to the contrary, I still
strenuously believe that I did so! I have more than half a
mind ("Little Dorrit" and my other occupations notwithstanding)
to charge you with having forgotten my reply!!
I have even a wild idea that Townshend reproached me,
when the last old year was new, with writing to you instead
of to him!!! We will argue it out, as well as we can argue
anything without poor dear Haldimand, when I come back
to Elys&eacute;e. In any case, however, don't discontinue your
annual letter, because it has become an expected and a
delightful part of the season to me.</p>

<p>With one of the prettiest houses in London, and every
conceivable (and inconceivable) luxury in it, Townshend is
voluntarily undergoing his own sentence of transportation in
Nervi, a beastly little place near Genoa, where you would as
soon find a herd of wild elephants in any villa as comfort.
He has a notion that he <i>must</i> be out of England in the
winter, but I believe him to be altogether wrong (as I have
just told him in a letter), unless he could just take his
society with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Workmen are now battering and smashing down my
theatre here, where we have just been acting a new play of
great merit, done in what I may call (modestly speaking of
the getting-up, and not of the acting) an unprecedented
way. I believe that anything so complete has never been
seen. We had an act at the North Pole, where the slightest
and greatest thing the eye beheld were equally taken from
the books of the Polar voyagers. Out of thirty people,
there were certainly not two who might not have gone
straight to the North Pole itself, completely furnished for
the winter! It has been the talk of all London for these
three weeks. And now it is a mere chaos of scaffolding,
ladders, beams, canvases, paint-pots, sawdust, artificial
snow, gas-pipes, and ghastliness. I have taken such pains
with it for these ten weeks in all my leisure hours, that I
feel now shipwrecked&mdash;as if I had never been without a
play on my hands before. A third topic comes up as this
ceases.</p>

<p>Down at Gad's Hill, near Rochester, in Kent&mdash;Shakespeare's
Gad's Hill, where Falstaff engaged in the robbery&mdash;is
a quaint little country-house of Queen Anne's time. I
happened to be walking past, a year and a half or so ago,
with my sub-editor of "Household Words," when I said to
him: "You see that house? It has always a curious
interest for me, because when I was a small boy down in
these parts I thought it the most beautiful house (I suppose
because of its famous old cedar-trees) ever seen. And my
poor father used to bring me to look at it, and used to say
that if I ever grew up to be a clever man perhaps I might
own that house, or such another house. In remembrance
of which, I have always in passing looked to see if it was
to be sold or let, and it has never been to me like any other
house, and it has never changed at all." We came back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
town, and my friend went out to dinner. Next morning he
came to me in great excitement, and said: "It is written
that you were to have that house at Gad's Hill. The lady
I had allotted to me to take down to dinner yesterday
began to speak of that neighbourhood. 'You know it?' I
said; 'I have been there to-day.' 'O yes,' said she, 'I
know it very well. I was a child there, in the house they
call Gad's Hill Place. My father was the rector, and lived
there many years. He has just died, has left it to me, and
I want to sell it.' 'So,' says the sub-editor, 'you must buy
it. Now or never!'" I did, and hope to pass next summer
there, though I may, perhaps, let it afterwards, furnished,
from time to time.</p>

<p>All about myself I find, and the little sheet nearly full!
But I know, my dear Cerjat, the subject will have its
interest for you, so I give it its swing. Mrs. Watson was
to have been at the play, but most unfortunately had three
children sick of gastric fever, and could not leave them.
She was here some three weeks before, looking extremely
well in the face, but rather thin. I have not heard of your
friend Mr. Percival Skelton, but I much misdoubt an
amateur artist's success in this vast place. I hope you
detected a remembrance of our happy visit to the Great
St. Bernard in a certain number of "Little Dorrit"? Tell
Mrs. Cerjat, with my love, that the opinions I have
expressed to her on the subject of cows have become
matured in my mind by experience and venerable age; and
that I denounce the race as humbugs, who have been
getting into poetry and all sorts of places without the
smallest reason. Haldimand's housekeeper is an awful
woman to consider. Pray give him our kindest regards
and remembrances, if you ever find him in a mood to
take it. "Our" means Mrs. Dickens's, Georgie's, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
mine. We often, often talk of our old days at Lausanne,
and send loving regard to Mrs. Cerjat and all your house.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Macready</span>,</div>

<p>Your friend and servant is as calm as Pecksniff,
saving for his knitted brows now turning into cordage over
Little Dorrit. The theatre has disappeared, the house is
restored to its usual conditions of order, the family are
tranquil and domestic, dove-eyed peace is enthroned in this
study, fire-eyed radicalism in its master's breast.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that our poetess is at work again,
and shall be very much pleased to have some more contributions
from her.</p>

<p>Love from all to your dear sister, and to Katie, and to
all the house.</p>

<p>We dined yesterday at Frederick Pollock's. I begged
an amazing photograph of you, and brought it away. It
strikes me as one of the most ludicrous things I ever saw
in my life. I think of taking a public-house, and having
it copied larger, for the size. You may remember it? Very
square and big&mdash;the Saracen's Head with its hair cut, and
in modern gear? Staring very hard? As your particular
friend, I would not part with it on any consideration. I
will never get such a wooden head again.</p>

you for your kind and welcome remembrance, and to assure
you that your Joseph is proud of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>For about ten minutes after his death, on each occasion
of that event occurring, Richard Wardour was in a floored
condition. And one night, to the great terror of Devonshire,
the Arctic Regions, and Newfoundland (all of which localities
were afraid to speak to him, as his ghost sat by the kitchen
fire in its rags), he very nearly did what he never did, went
and fainted off, dead, again. But he always plucked up, on
the turn of ten minutes, and became facetious.</p>

<p>Likewise he chipped great pieces out of all his limbs
(solely, as I imagine, from moral earnestness and concussion
of passion, for I never know him to hit himself in any way)
and terrified Aldersley<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to that degree, by lunging at him to
carry him into the cave, that the said Aldersley always
shook like a mould of jelly, and muttered, "By G&mdash;&mdash;, this
is an awful thing!"</p>

<p>I send these lines by Mary and Katey, to report my
love to all.</p>

<p>Your note about the <i>Golden Mary</i> gave me great pleasure;
though I don't believe in one part of it; for I
honestly believe that your story, as really belonging to the
rest of the narrative, had been generally separated from
the other stories, and greatly liked. I had not that particular
shipwreck that you mention in my mind (indeed I
doubt if I know it), and John Steadiman merely came into
my head as a staunch sort of name that suited the character.
The number has done "Household Words" great service,
and has decidedly told upon its circulation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>You should have come to the play. I much doubt if
anything so complete will ever be seen again. An incredible
amount of pains and ingenuity was expended on it, and the
result was most remarkable even to me.</p>

<p>When are you going to send something more to
H. W.? Are you lazy?? Low-spirited??? Pining for
Paris????</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Lord Carlisle</span>,</div>

<p>I am writing by the river-side for a few days, and
at the end of last week &mdash;&mdash; appeared here with your note
of introduction. I was not in the way; but as &mdash;&mdash; had
come express from London with it, Mrs. Dickens opened it,
and gave her (in the limited sense which was of no use to
her) an audience. She did not quite seem to know what
she wanted of me. But she said she had understood at
Stafford House that I had a theatre in which she could
read; with a good deal of modesty and diffidence she at
last got so far. Now, my little theatre turns my house
out of window, costs fifty pounds to put up, and is only
two months taken down; therefore, is quite out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
question. This Mrs. Dickens explained, and also my profound
inability to do anything for &mdash;&mdash; readings which
they could not do for themselves. She appeared fully to
understand the explanation, and indeed to have anticipated
for herself how powerless I must be in such a case.</p>

<p>She described herself as being consumptive, and as
being subject to an effusion of blood from the lungs; about
the last condition, one would think, poor woman, for the
exercise of public elocution as an art.</p>

<p>Between ourselves, I think the whole idea a mistake,
and have thought so from its first announcement. It has a
fatal appearance of trading upon Uncle Tom, and am I not
a man and a brother? which you may be by all means, and
still not have the smallest claim to my attention as a public
reader. The town is over-read from all the white squares
on the draught-board; it has been considerably harried
from all the black squares&mdash;now with the aid of old banjoes,
and now with the aid of Exeter Hall; and I have a very
strong impression that it is by no means to be laid hold of
from this point of address. I myself, for example, am the
meekest of men, and in abhorrence of slavery yield to no
human creature, and yet I don't admit the sequence that I
want Uncle Tom (or Aunt Tomasina) to expound "King
Lear" to me. And I believe my case to be the case of
thousands.</p>

<p>I trouble you with this much about it, because I am
naturally desirous you should understand that if I could
possibly have been of any service, or have suggested
anything to this poor lady, I would not have lost the
opportunity. But I cannot help her, and I assure you
that I cannot honestly encourage her to hope. I fear her
enterprise has no hope in it.</p>

<p>In your absence I have always followed you through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
papers, and felt a personal interest and pleasure in the
public affection in which you are held over there.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At the
same time I must confess that I should prefer to have you
here, where good public men seem to me to be dismally
wanted. I have no sympathy with demagogues, but am a
grievous Radical, and think the political signs of the times
to be just about as bad as the spirit of the people will admit
of their being. In all other respects I am as healthy, sound,
and happy as your kindness can wish. So you will set
down my political despondency as my only disease.</p>

<p>On the tip-top of Gad's Hill, between this and Rochester,
on the very spot where Falstaff ran away, I have a pretty
little old-fashioned house, which I shall live in the hope of
showing to you one day. Also I have a little story respecting
the manner in which it became mine, which I hope (on
the same occasion in the clouds) to tell you. Until then
and always, I am, dear Lord Carlisle,</p>

<div class='sig'>
Yours very faithfully and obliged.<br />

<p>I have gone over Dilke's memoranda, and I think it
quite right and necessary that those points should be stated.
Nor do I see the least difficulty in the way of their introduction
into the pamphlet. But I do not deem it possible to get
the pamphlet written and published before the dinner. I
have so many matters pressing on my attention, that I cannot
turn to it immediately on my release from my book just
finished. It shall be done and distributed early next month.</p>

<p>As to anything being lost by its not being in the hands
of the people who dine (as you seem to think), I have not
the least misgiving on that score. They would say, if it
were issued, just what they will say without it.</p>

<p>Lord Granville is committed to taking the chair, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
make the best speech he can in it. The pious &mdash;&mdash; will cram
him with as many distortions of the truth as his stomach may
be strong enough to receive. &mdash;&mdash;, with Bardolphian eloquence,
will cool his nose in the modest merits of the institution.
&mdash;&mdash; will make a neat and appropriate speech on both
sides, round the corner and over the way. And all this would
be done exactly to the same purpose and in just the same
strain, if twenty thousand copies of the pamphlet had been
circulated.</p>

<p>My emancipation having been effected on Saturday,
the ninth of this month, I take some shame to myself for
not having sooner answered your note. But the host of
things to be done as soon as I was free, and the tremendous
number of ingenuities to be wrought out at Gad's Hill, have
kept me in a whirl of their own ever since.</p>

<p>We purpose going to Gad's Hill for the summer on the
1st of June; as, apart from the master's eye being a
necessary ornament to the spot, I clearly see that the workmen
yet lingering in the yard must be squeezed out by
bodily pressure, or they will never go. How will this suit
you and yours? If you will come down, we can take you
all in, on your way north; that is to say, we shall have that
ample verge and room enough, until about the eighth;
when Hans Christian Andersen (who has been "coming"
for about three years) will come for a fortnight's stay in
England. I shall like you to see the little old-fashioned
place. It strikes me as being comfortable.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Stone</span>,</div>

<p>I know that what I am going to say will not be
agreeable; but I rely on the authoress's good sense; and
say it, knowing it to be the truth.</p>

<p>These "Notes" are destroyed by too much smartness.
It gives the appearance of perpetual effort, stabs to the
heart the nature that is in them, and wearies by the manner
and not by the matter. It is the commonest fault in the
world (as I have constant occasion to observe here), but it
is a very great one. Just as you couldn't bear to have an
&eacute;pergne or a candlestick on your table, supported by a
light figure always on tiptoe and evidently in an impossible
attitude for the sustainment of its weight, so all readers
would be more or less oppressed and worried by this presentation
of everything in one smart point of view, when
they know it must have other, and weightier, and more
solid properties. Airiness and good spirits are always delightful,
and are inseparable from notes of a cheerful trip;
but they should sympathise with many things as well as see
them in a lively way. It is but a word or a touch that expresses
this humanity, but without that little embellishment
of good nature there is no such thing as humour. In this
little MS. everything is too much patronised and condescended
to, whereas the slightest touch of feeling for the
rustic who is of the earth earthy, or of sisterhood with the
homely servant who has made her face shine in her desire to
please, would make a difference that the writer can scarcely
imagine without trying it. The only relief in the twenty-one
slips is the little bit about the chimes. It <i>is</i> a relief,
simply because it is an indication of some kind of sentiment.
You don't want any sentiment laboriously made out in such
a thing. You don't want any maudlin show of it. But you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
do want a pervading suggestion that it is there. It makes
all the difference between being playful and being cruel.
Again I must say, above all things&mdash;especially to young
people writing: For the love of God don't condescend!
Don't assume the attitude of saying, "See how clever I am,
and what fun everybody else is!" Take any shape but that.</p>

<p>I observe an excellent quality of observation throughout,
and think the boy at the shop, and all about him, particularly
good. I have no doubt whatever that the rest of
the journal will be much better if the writer chooses to
make it so. If she considers for a moment within herself,
she will know that she derived pleasure from everything
she saw, because she saw it with innumerable lights and
shades upon it, and bound to humanity by innumerable fine
links; she cannot possibly communicate anything of that
pleasure to another by showing it from one little limited
point only, and that point, observe, the one from which it is
impossible to detach the exponent as the patroness of a
whole universe of inferior souls. This is what everybody
would mean in objecting to these notes (supposing them to
be published), that they are too smart and too flippant.</p>

<p>As I understand this matter to be altogether between
us three, and as I think your confidence, and hers, imposes
a duty of friendship on me, I discharge it to the best of my
ability. Perhaps I make more of it than you may have
meant or expected; if so, it is because I am interested and
wish to express it. If there had been anything in my
objection not perfectly easy of removal, I might, after all,
have hesitated to state it; but that is not the case. A very
little indeed would make all this gaiety as sound and wholesome
and good-natured in the reader's mind as it is in the
writer's.</p>

<p>Coming home here last night, from a day's business
in London, I found your most excellent note awaiting me,
in which I have had a pleasure to be derived from none but
good and natural things. I can now honestly assure you
that I believe you will write <i>well</i>, and that I have a lively

observation need nothing but the little touches on which
we are both agreed. And I am perfectly sure that they
will be as pleasant to you as to anyone, for nobody can see
so well as you do, without feeling kindly too.</p>

<p>To confess the truth to you, I was half sorry, yesterday,
that I had been so unreserved; but not half as sorry,

adding that there is a noble candour and modesty in your
note, which I shall never be able to separate from you

<p>Here is a very serious business on the great estate
respecting the water supply. Last night, they had pumped
the well dry merely in raising the family supply for the
day; and this morning (very little water having been got
into the cisterns) it is dry again! It is pretty clear to me
that we must look the thing in the face, and at once bore
deeper, dig, or do some beastly thing or other, to secure
this necessary in abundance. Meanwhile I am in a most
plaintive and forlorn condition without your presence and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
counsel. I raise my voice in the wilderness and implore the
same!!!</p>

<p>Wild legends are in circulation among the servants
how that Captain Goldsmith on the knoll above&mdash;the skipper
in that crow's-nest of a house&mdash;has millions of gallons of
water always flowing for him. Can he have damaged my
well? Can we imitate him, and have our millions of
gallons? Goldsmith or I must fall, so I conceive.</p>

<p>If you get this, send me a telegraph message informing
me when I may expect comfort. I am held by four of the
family while I write this, in case I should do myself a
mischief&mdash;it certainly won't be taking to drinking water.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your Indian information. I shall
act upon it in the most exact manner. Walter sails next
Monday. Charley and I go down with him to Southampton
next Sunday. We are all delighted with the prospect of
seeing you at Gad's Hill. These are my Jerrold engagements:
On Friday, the 24th, I have to repeat my reading at
St. Martin's Hall; on Saturday, the 25th, to repeat "The
Frozen Deep" at the Gallery of Illustration for the last time.
On Thursday, the 30th, or Friday, the 31st, I shall probably
read at Manchester. Deane, the general manager of the
Exhibition, is going down to-night, and will arrange all the
preliminaries for me. If you and I went down to Manchester
together, and were there on a Sunday, he would give us the
whole Exhibition to ourselves. It is probable, I think (as
he estimates the receipts of a night at about seven hundred
pounds), that we may, in about a fortnight or so after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reading, play "The Frozen Deep" at Manchester. But of
this contingent engagement I at present know no more than
you do.</p>

<p>Now, will you, upon this exposition of affairs, choose your
own time for coming to us, and, when you have made your
choice, write to me at Gad's Hill? I am going down this
afternoon for rest (which means violent cricket with the
boys) after last Saturday night; which was a teaser, but
triumphant. The St. Martin's Hall audience was, I must
confess, a very extraordinary thing. The two thousand and
odd people were like one, and their enthusiasm was something
awful.</p>

<p>Yet I have seen that before, too. Your young remembrance
cannot recall the man; but he flourished in my day&mdash;a
great actor, sir&mdash;a noble actor&mdash;thorough artist! I
have seen him do wonders in that way. He retired from
the stage early in life (having a monomaniacal delusion that
he was old), and is said to be still living in your county.</p>

<p>All join in kindest love to your dear sister and all the
rest.</p>

<p>Although I date this ashore, I really write it from
Southampton (don't notice this fact in your reply, for I
shall be in town on Wednesday). I have come here on
an errand which will grow familiar to you before you know
that Time has flapped his wings over your head. Like me,
you will find those babies grow to be young men before you
are quite sure they are born. Like me, you will have great
teeth drawn with a wrench, and will only then know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

what they call, in Green Bush melodramas, "the Big Drink,"
and I don't at all know this day how he comes to be mine,
or I his.</p>

<p>I don't write to say this&mdash;or to say how seeing Charley,
and he going aboard the ship before me just now, I
suddenly came into possession of a photograph of my own
back at sixteen and twenty, and also into a suspicion that
I had doubled the last age. I merely write to mention
that Telbin and his wife are going down to Gad's Hill with
us, about mid-day next Sunday, and that if you and Mrs.
Yates will come too, we shall be delighted to have you.
We can give you a bed, and you can be in town (if you
have such a savage necessity) by twenty minutes before ten
on Monday morning.</p>

your account of the reading in <i>The Daily News</i>. I thank

the New Free Trade Hall, on the nights of Friday and
Saturday, the 21st and 22nd August.</p>

<p>The place is out of the question for my girls. Their

sociably and happily, that I am emboldened to ask you
whether you would play my sister-in-law Georgina's part
(Compton and babies permitting).</p>

<p>We shall go down in the old pleasant way, and shall

Sunday; when even "he" (as Rogers always called every

<p>What do you say? What does he say? and what does
baby say? When I use the term "baby," I use it in two

<p>Answer me at this address, like the Juliet I saw at

<p>We are going to wind up by acting at Manchester (on
solemn requisition) on the evenings of Friday and Saturday,
the 21st and 22nd (actresses substituted for the girls, of
course). We shall have to leave here on the morning of
the 20th. You thought of coming on the 16th; can't
you make it a day or two earlier, so as to be with us a
whole week? Decide and pronounce. Again, cannot you
bring Katey with you? Decide and pronounce thereupon,
also.</p>

<p>I read at Manchester last Friday. As many thousand
people were there as you like to name. The collection of
pictures in the Exhibition is wonderful. And the power
with which the modern English school asserts itself is a
very gratifying and delightful thing to behold. The care
for the common people, in the provision made for their
comfort and refreshment, is also admirable and worthy of
all commendation. But they want more amusement, and
particularly (as it strikes me) <i>something in motion</i>, though
it were only a twisting fountain. The thing is too still
after their lives of machinery, and art flies over their heads
in consequence.</p>

<p>I hope you have seen my tussle with the "Edinburgh."
I saw the chance last Friday week, as I was going down to
read the "Carol" in St. Martin's Hall. Instantly turned
to, then and there, and wrote half the article. Flew out of
bed early next morning, and finished it by noon. Went
down to Gallery of Illustration (we acted that night), did
the day's business, corrected the proofs in Polar costume in
dressing-room, broke up two numbers of "Household
Words" to get it out directly, played in "Frozen Deep"
and "Uncle John," presided at supper of company, made
no end of speeches, went home and gave in completely for
four hours, then got sound asleep, and next day was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

<p>Now here, without any preface, is a good, confounding,
stunning question for you&mdash;would you like to play
"Uncle John" on the two nights at Manchester?</p>

<p>It is not a long part. You could have a full rehearsal
on the Friday, and I could sit in the wing at night and pull
you through all the business. Perhaps you might not
object to being in the thing in your own native place, and
the relief to me would be enormous.</p>

<p>This is what has come into my head lying in bed to-day
(I have been in bed all day), and this is just my plain
reason for writing to you.</p>

<p>It's a capital part, and you are a capital old man. You
know the play as we play it, and the Manchester people
don't. Say the word, and I'll send you my own book by
return of post.</p>

<p>The agitation and exertion of Richard Wardour are so
great to me, that I cannot rally my spirits in the short space
of time I get. The strain is so great to make a show of
doing it, that I want to be helped out of "Uncle John" if
I can. Think of yourself far more than me; but if you half
think you are up to the joke, and half doubt your being so,
then give me the benefit of the doubt and play the part.</p>

<p>Answer me at Gad's Hill.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If you play, I shall immediately announce it to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>At last, I am happy to inform you, we have got at a
famous spring!! It rushed in this morning, ten foot deep.
And our friends talk of its supplying "a ton a minute for
yourself and your family, sir, for nevermore."</p>

<p>They ask leave to bore ten feet lower, to prevent the
possibility of what they call "a choking with sullage."
Likewise, they are going to insert "a rose-headed pipe;"
at the mention of which implement, I am (secretly) well-nigh
distracted, having no idea of what it means. But I
have said "Yes," besides instantly standing a bottle of gin.
Can you come back, and can you get down on Monday

<p>I received your kind note this morning, and write
this reply here to take to London with me and post in
town, being bound for that village and three days' drill
of the professional ladies who are to succeed the Tavistock
girls.</p>

<p>My book I enclose. There is a slight alteration (which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

the piece may be played through without having the drop

<p>Now, as to the dress. You will want a pair of pumps,

The extravagantly and anciently-frilled shirts
that I have had got up for the part, I will bring you down;
large white waistcoat, I will bring you down; large white

Manchester. There then remain only a pair of common
nankeen tights, to button below the calf, and blue wedding-coat.
The nankeen tights you had best get made at once;
my "Uncle John" coat I will send you down in a parcel by
to-morrow's train, to have altered in Manchester to your
shape and figure. You will then be quite independent of
Christian chance and Jewish Nathan, which latter potentate
is now at Canterbury with the cricket amateurs, and might
fail.</p>

<p>A Thursday's rehearsal is (unfortunately) now impracticable,
the passes for the railway being all made out,
and the company's sailing orders issued. But, as I have
already suggested, with a careful rehearsal on Friday
morning, and with me at the wing at night to put you
right, you will find yourself sliding through it easily. There
is nothing in the least complicated in the business. As to
the dance, you have only to knock yourself up for a twelvemonth
and it will go nobly.</p>

<p>After all, too, if you <i>should</i>, through any unlucky breakdown,
come to be afraid of it, I am no worse off than I was
before, if I have to do it at last. Keep your pecker up
with that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>I am heartily obliged to you, my dear old boy, for your
affectionate and considerate note, and I wouldn't have you

me&mdash;unless you are quite comfortable in it, and able to
enjoy it.</p>

<p>I sent you a telegraph message last night, in total
contradiction of the letter you received from me this
morning.</p>

<p>The reason was simply this: Arthur Smith and the
other business men, both in Manchester and here, urged
upon me, in the strongest manner, that they were afraid of
the change; that it was well known in Manchester that I
had done the part in London; that there was a danger of
its being considered disrespectful in me to give it up; also
that there was a danger that it might be thought that I did
so at the last minute, after an immense let, whereas I
might have done it at first, etc. etc. etc. Having no
desire but for the success of our object, and a becoming
recognition on my part of the kind Manchester public's
cordiality, I gave way, and thought it best to go on.</p>

<p>I do so against the grain, and against every inclination,
and against the strongest feeling of gratitude to you. My
people at home will be miserable too when they hear I am
going to do it. If I could have heard from you sooner, and
got the bill out sooner, I should have been firmer in considering
my own necessity of relief. As it is, I sneak
under; and I hope you will feel the reasons, and approve.</p>

<p>The second conspirator has been here this morning
to ask whether you wish the windlass to be left in the yard,
and whether you will want him and his mate any more, and,
if so, when? Of course he says (rolling something in the
form of a fillet in at one broken tooth all the while, and
rolling it out at another) that they could wish fur to have
the windlass if it warn't any ways a hill conwenience fur to
fetch her away. I have told him that if he will come back
on Friday he shall have your reply. Will you, therefore,
send it me by return of post? He says he'll "look up"

<p>On Monday I am going away with Collins for ten days

<p>Think of Collins's usual luck with me! We went up a
Cumberland mountain yesterday&mdash;a huge black hill, fifteen
hundred feet high. We took for a guide a capital innkeeper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hard by. It rained in torrents&mdash;as it only does rain
in a hill country&mdash;the whole time. At the top, there were
black mists and the darkness of night. It then came out
that the innkeeper had not been up for twenty years, and
he lost his head and himself altogether; and we couldn't
get down again! What wonders the Inimitable performed
with his compass until it broke with the heat and
wet of his pocket no matter; it did break, and then we
wandered about, until it was clear to the Inimitable that
the night must be passed there, and the enterprising
travellers probably die of cold. We took our own way
about coming down, struck, and declared that the guide
might wander where he would, but we would follow a watercourse
we lighted upon, and which must come at last to
the river. This necessitated amazing gymnastics; in the
course of which performances, Collins fell into the said
watercourse with his ankle sprained, and the great
ligament of the foot and leg swollen I don't know how
big.</p>

<p>How I enacted Wardour over again in carrying him
down, and what a business it was to get him down; I may
say in Gibbs's words: "Vi lascio a giudicare!" But he was
got down somehow, and we got off the mountain somehow;
and now I carry him to bed, and into and out of carriages,
exactly like Wardour in private life. I don't believe he
will stand for a month to come. He has had a doctor, and
can wear neither shoe nor stocking, and has his foot
wrapped up in a flannel waistcoat, and has a breakfast
saucer of liniment, and a horrible dabbling of lotion incessantly
in progress. We laugh at it all, but I doubt very
much whether he can go on to Doncaster. It will be a
miserable blow to our H. W. scheme, and I say nothing
about it as yet; but he is really so crippled that I doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the getting him there. We have resolved to fall to work
to-morrow morning and begin our writing; and there, for
the present, that point rests.</p>

<p>This is a little place with fifty houses, five bathing-machines,
five girls in straw hats, five men in straw hats,
and no other company. The little houses are all in half-mourning&mdash;yellow
stone on white stone, and black; and it
reminds me of what Broadstairs might have been if it had
not inherited a cliff, and had been an Irishman. But this
is a capital little homely inn, looking out upon the sea; and
we are really very comfortably lodged. I can just stand
upright in my bedroom. Otherwise, it is a good deal like
one of Ballard's top-rooms. We have a very obliging and
comfortable landlady; and it is a clean nice place in a rough
wild country. We came here haphazard, but could not
have done better.</p>

<p>We lay last night at a place called Wigton&mdash;also in
half-mourning&mdash;with the wonderful peculiarity that it had
no population, no business, no streets to speak of; but five
linendrapers within range of our small windows, one linendraper's
next door, and five more linendrapers round the
corner. I ordered a night-light in my bedroom. A queer
little old woman brought me one of the common Child's
night-lights, and seeming to think that I looked at it with
interest, said: "It's joost a vara keeyourious thing, sir, and
joost new coom oop. It'll burn awt hoors a' end, an no
gootther, nor no waste, nor ony sike a thing, if you can
creedit what I say, seein' the airticle."</p>

<p>Of course <i>I</i> shall go to Doncaster, whether or no (please
God), and my postage directions to you remain unchanged.

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>I received your letter at Allonby yesterday, and was
delighted to get it. We came back to Carlisle last night
(to a capital inn, kept by Breach's brother), and came on
here to-day. We are on our way to Doncaster; but Sabbath
observance throws all the trains out; and although
it is not a hundred miles from here, we shall have, as well as
I can make out the complicated lists of trains, to sleep at
Leeds&mdash;which I particularly detest as an odious place&mdash;to-morrow
night.</p>

<p>Accustomed as you are to the homage which men
delight to render to the Inimitable, you would be scarcely
prepared for the proportions it assumes in this northern
country. Station-masters assist him to alight from carriages,
deputations await him in hotel entries, innkeepers
bow down before him and put him into regal rooms, the
town goes down to the platform to see him off, and
Collins's ankle goes into the newspapers!!!</p>

<p>It is a great deal better than it was, and he can get into
new hotels and up the stairs with two thick sticks, like an
admiral in a farce. His spirits have improved in a corresponding
degree, and he contemplates cheerfully the keeping
house at Doncaster. I thought (as I told you) he would
never have gone there, but he seems quite up to the mark
now. Of course he can never walk out, or see anything of
any place. We have done our first paper for H. W., and
sent it up to the printer's.</p>

<p>The landlady of the little inn at Allonby lived at Greta
Bridge, in Yorkshire, when I went down there before
"Nickleby," and was smuggled into the room to see me,
when I was secretly found out. She is an immensely fat
woman now. "But I could tuck my arm round her waist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
then, Mr. Dickens," the landlord said when she told me the
story as I was going to bed the night before last. "And
can't you do it now," I said, "you insensible dog? Look
at me! Here's a picture!" Accordingly, I got round as
much of her as I could; and this gallant action was the
most successful I have ever performed, on the whole. I
think it was the dullest little place I ever entered; and
what with the monotony of an idle sea, and what with the
monotony of another sea in the room (occasioned by Collins's
perpetually holding his ankle over a pail of salt water, and
laving it with a milk jug), I struck yesterday, and came
away.</p>

<p>We are in a very remarkable old house here, with
genuine old rooms and an uncommonly quaint staircase. I
have a state bedroom, with two enormous red four-posters
in it, each as big as Charley's room at Gad's Hill. Bellew
is to preach here to-morrow. "And we know he is a friend
of yours, sir," said the landlord, when he presided over the
serving of the dinner (two little salmon trout; a sirloin
steak; a brace of partridges; seven dishes of sweets; five
dishes of dessert, led off by a bowl of peaches; and in the
centre an enormous bride-cake&mdash;"We always have it here,
sir," said the landlord, "custom of the house.") (Collins
turned pale, and estimated the dinner at half a guinea
each.)</p>

<p>This is the stupidest of letters, but all description is
gone, or going, into "The Lazy Tour of Two Idle
Apprentices."</p>

<p>Kiss the darling Plorn, who is often in my thoughts.
Best love to Charley, Mamey, and Katie. I will write to
you again from Doncaster, where I shall be rejoiced to find
another letter from you.</p>

I am not going to the course this morning, but have engaged
a carriage (open, and pair) for to-morrow and Friday.</p>

<p>"The Frozen Deep's" author gets on as well as could
be expected. He can hobble up and down stairs when
absolutely necessary, and limps to his bedroom on the same
floor. He talks of going to the theatre to-night in a cab,
which will be the first occasion of his going out, except to
travel, since the accident. He sends his kind regards and
thanks for enquiries and condolence. I am perpetually
tidying the rooms after him, and carrying all sorts of untidy
things which belong to him into his bedroom, which is a
picture of disorder. You will please to imagine mine, airy
and clean, little dressing-room attached, eight water-jugs (I
never saw such a supply), capital sponge-bath, perfect
arrangement, and exquisite neatness. We breakfast at
half-past eight, and fall to work for H. W. afterwards.
Then I go out, and&mdash;hem! look for subjects.</p>

<p>The mayor called this morning to do the honours of
the town, whom it pleased the Inimitable to receive with
great courtesy and affability. He propounded invitation to
public <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>, which it did <i>not</i> please the Inimitable to
receive, and which he graciously rejected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I find on enquiry that the "General Theatrical

certainly not do so again, saving on some very strong and
exceptional case. As its trustee, I could not represent to it

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>All</span> through this year, Charles Dickens was constantly
moving about from place to place. After much and careful
consideration, he had come to the determination of, for the
future, giving readings for his own benefit. And although in
the spring of this year he gave one reading of his "Christmas
Carol" for a charity, all the other readings, beginning from
the 29th April, and ever after, were for himself. In the
autumn of this year he made reading tours in England, Scotland,
and Ireland, always accompanied by his friend and
secretary, Mr. Arthur Smith. At Newcastle, Charles Dickens
was joined by his daughters, who accompanied him in his
Scotch tour. The letters to his sister-in-law, and to his
eldest daughter, are all given here, and will be given in all
future reading tours, as they form a complete diary of his
life and movements at these times. To avoid the constant
repetition of the two names, the beginning of the
letters will be dispensed with in all cases where they follow
each other in unbroken succession. The Mr. Frederick
Lehmann mentioned in the letter written from Sheffield, had
married a daughter of Mr. Robert Chambers, and niece of
Mrs. Wills. Coming to settle in London a short time after
this date, Mr. and Mrs. Lehmann became intimately known
to Charles Dickens and his family&mdash;more especially to his
eldest daughter, to whom they have been, and are, the
kindest and truest of friends. The "pretty little boy"
mentioned as being under Mrs. Wills's care, was their eldest
son.</div>

<p>We give the letter to Mr. Thackeray, not because it is
one of very great interest, but because, being the only one
we have, we are glad to have the two names associated
together in this work.</p>

<p>The "little speech" alluded to in this first letter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Mr. Macready was one made by Charles Dickens at a public
dinner, which was given in aid of the Hospital for Sick
Children, in Great Ormond Street. He afterwards (early in
April) gave a reading from his "Christmas Carol" for this
same charity.</p>

<p>The Christmas number of "Household Words," mentioned
in a letter to Mr. Wilkie Collins, was called "A House
to Let," and contained stories written by Charles Dickens,
Mr. Wilkie Collins, and other contributors to "Household
Words."</p>

<p>I am very sorry to receive so bad an account of the
foot. But I hope it is all in the past tense now.</p>

<p>I met with an incident the other day, which I think is a
good deal in your way, for introduction either into a long or
short story. Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Monro went over
St. Luke's with me (only last Friday), to show me some
distinctly and remarkably developed types of insanity.
Among other patients, we passed a deaf and dumb man,
now afflicted with incurable madness too, of whom they
said that it was only when his madness began to develop
itself in strongly-marked mad actions, that it began to be
suspected. "Though it had been there, no doubt, some
time." This led me to consider, suspiciously, what employment
he had been in, and so to ask the question. "Aye,"
says Dr. Sutherland, "that is the most remarkable thing of
all, Mr. Dickens. He was employed in the transmission of
electric-telegraph messages; and it is impossible to conceive
what delirious despatches that man may have been sending
about all over the world!"</p>

<p>Rejoiced to hear such good report of the play.</p>

<p>Your quotation is, as I supposed, all wrong. The
text is <i>not</i> "which his 'owls was organs." When Mr.
Harris went into an empty dog-kennel, to spare his sensitive
nature the anguish of overhearing Mrs. Harris's exclamations
on the occasion of the birth of her first child (the
Princess Royal of the Harris family), "he never took his
hands away from his ears, or came out once, till he was
showed the baby." On encountering that spectacle, he was
(being of a weakly constitution) "took with fits." For
this distressing complaint he was medically treated; the
doctor "collared him, and laid him on his back upon the
airy stones"&mdash;please to observe what follows&mdash;"and she
was told, to ease her mind, his 'owls was organs."</p>

<p>That is to say, Mrs. Harris, lying exhausted on her bed,
in the first sweet relief of freedom from pain, merely
covered with the counterpane, and not yet "put comfortable,"
hears a noise apparently proceeding from the
back-yard, and says, in a flushed and hysterical manner:
"What 'owls are those? Who is a-'owling? Not my
ugebond?" Upon which the doctor, looking round one of
the bottom posts of the bed, and taking Mrs. Harris's pulse
in a reassuring manner, says, with much admirable presence
of mind: "Howls, my dear madam?&mdash;no, no, no!
What are we thinking of? Howls, my dear Mrs. Harris?
Ha, ha, ha! Organs, ma'am, organs. Organs in the streets,
Mrs. Harris; no howls."</p>

<p>The wisdom of Parliament, in that expensive act of
its greatness which constitutes the Guild, prohibits that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
corporation <i>from doing anything</i> until it shall have existed
in a perfectly useless condition for seven years. This
clause (introduced by some private-bill magnate of official
might) seemed so ridiculous, that nobody could believe it
to have this meaning; but as I felt clear about it when we
were on the very verge of granting an excellent literary
annuity, I referred the point to counsel, and my construction
was confirmed without a doubt.</p>

<p>It is therefore needless to enquire whether an association
in the nature of a provident society could address itself to
such a case as you confide to me. The prohibition has still
two or three years of life in it.</p>

<p>But, assuming the gentleman's title to be considered as
an "author" as established, there is no question that it
comes within the scope of the Literary Fund. They would
habitually "lend" money if they did what I consider to be
their duty; as it is they only give money, but they give it

<p>I most heartily and honestly congratulate you on
your charming little piece. It moved me more than I could
easily tell you, if I were to try. Except "La Joie fait
Peur," I have seen nothing nearly so good, and there is a
subtlety in the comfortable presentation of the child who
is to become a devoted woman for Reuben's sake, which
goes a long way beyond Madame de Girardin. I am at a
loss to let you know how much I admired it last night, or
how heartily I cried over it. A touching idea, most delicately
conceived and wrought out by a true artist and poet,
in a spirit of noble, manly generosity, that no one should
be able to study without great emotion.</p>

<p>It is extremely well acted by all concerned; but Mr.
Dillon's performance is really admirable, and deserving of
the highest commendation. It is good in these days to see
an actor taking such pains, and expressing such natural and
vigorous sentiment. There is only one thing I should have
liked him to change. I am much mistaken if any man&mdash;least
of all any such man&mdash;would crush a letter written by
the hand of the woman he loved. Hold it to his heart
unconsciously and look about for it the while, he might;
or he might do any other thing with it that expressed a
habit of tenderness and affection in association with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
idea of her; but he would never crush it under any circumstances.
He would as soon crush her heart.</p>

<p>You will see how closely I went with him, by my
minding so slight an incident in so fine a performance.
There is no one who could approach him in it; and I am
bound to add that he surprised me as much as he pleased me.</p>

<p>I think it might be worth while to try the people at the
Fran&ccedil;ais with the piece. They are very good in one-act
plays; such plays take well there, and this seems to me well
suited to them. If you would like Samson or Regnier to
read the play (in English), I know them well, and would
be very glad indeed to tell them that I sent it with your
sanction because I had been so much struck by it.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Faithfully yours always.<br />

<p>I want you to read the enclosed little play. You
will see that it is in one act&mdash;about the length of "La Joie
fait Pour." It is now acting at the Lyceum Theatre here,
with very great success. The author is Mr. Westland
Marston, a dramatic writer of reputation, who wrote a very
well-known tragedy called "The Patrician's Daughter,"
in which Macready and Miss Faucit acted (under Macready's
management at Drury Lane) some years ago.</p>

<p>This little piece is so very powerful on the stage, its
interest is so simple and natural, and the part of Reuben is
such a very fine one, that I cannot help thinking you might
make one grand <i>coup</i> with it, if with your skilful hand you
arranged it for the Fran&ccedil;ais. I have communicated this
idea of mine to the author, "<i>et l&agrave;-dessus je vous &eacute;cris</i>." I
am anxious to know your opinion, and shall expect with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
much interest to receive a little letter from you at your
convenience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dickens, Miss Hogarth, and all the house send a
thousand kind loves and regards to Madame Regnier and
the dear little boys. You will bring them to London when
you come, with all the force of the Fran&ccedil;ais&mdash;will you not?</p>

<p>Let me thank you with all my heart for your most
patient and kind letter. I made its contents known to
Mr. Marston, and I enclose you his reply. You will see that
he cheerfully leaves the matter in your hands, and abides
by your opinion and discretion.</p>

<p>You need not return his letter, my friend. There is
great excitement here this morning, in consequence of the
failure of the Ministry last night to carry the bill they
brought in to please your Emperor and his troops. <i>I</i>, for
one, am extremely glad of their defeat.</p>

<p>"Le vieux P&mdash;&mdash;," I have no doubt, will go staggering
down the Rue de la Paix to-day, with his stick in his hand
and his hat on one side, predicting the downfall of everything,
in consequence of this event. His handwriting
shakes more and more every quarter, and I think he mixes
a great deal of cognac with his ink. He always gives me
some astonishing piece of news (which is never true), or some
suspicious public prophecy (which is never verified), and he
always tells me he is dying (which he never is).</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear Regnier, accept a thousand thanks from

<p>I have safely received your cheque this morning, and
will hand it over forthwith to the honorary secretary of the
hospital. I hope you have read the little speech in the
hospital's publication of it. They had it taken by their
own shorthand-writer, and it is done verbatim.</p>

<p>You may be sure that it is a good and kind charity. It
is amazing to me that it is not at this day ten times as large
and rich as it is. But I hope and trust that I have happily
been able to give it a good thrust onward into a great
course. We all send our most affectionate love to all the
house. I am devising all sorts of things in my mind, and
am in a state of energetic restlessness incomprehensible to
the calm philosophers of Dorsetshire. What a dream it is,
this work and strife, and how little we do in the dream
after all! Only last night, in my sleep, I was bent upon
getting over a perspective of barriers, with my hands and
feet bound. Pretty much what we are all about, waking, I

<p>After the profoundest cogitation, I come reluctantly

But as you are not, I will not hear of the situation.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to think how many charming little

come to Kensington, boy in hand, as if I had walked (I
wish to God I had) out of a fairy tale! But no, I do <i>not</i>
know that orphan. He is crying somewhere, by himself, at
this moment. I can't dry his eyes. He is being neglected
by some ogress of a nurse. I can't rescue him.</p>

<p>I will make a point of going to the Athen&aelig;um on

Mr. Macdonald should have them all, for your sake.</p>

<p>For a good many years I have suffered a great deal
from charities, but never anything like what I suffer now.
The amount of correspondence they inflict upon me is really
incredible. But this is nothing. Benevolent men get
behind the piers of the gates, lying in wait for my going
out; and when I peep shrinkingly from my study-windows,
I see their pot-bellied shadows projected on the gravel.
Benevolent bullies drive up in hansom cabs (with engraved
portraits of their benevolent institutions hanging over the
aprons, like banners on their outward walls), and stay long
at the door. Benevolent area-sneaks get lost in the kitchens
and are found to impede the circulation of the knife-cleaning
machine. My man has been heard to say (at The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>I should vainly try to tell you&mdash;so I <i>won't</i> try&mdash;how
affected I have been by your warm-hearted letter, or how
thoroughly well convinced I always am of the truth and
earnestness of your friendship. I thank you, my dear, dear
fellow, with my whole soul. I fervently return that friendship
and I highly cherish it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>You want to know all about me? I am still reading in
London every Thursday, and the audiences are very great,
and the success immense. On the 2nd of August I am going
away on a tour of some four months in England, Ireland,
and Scotland. I shall read, during that time, not fewer than
four or five times a week. It will be sharp work; but probably
a certain musical clinking will come of it, which will
mitigate the hardship.</p>

<p>At this present moment I am on my little Kentish freehold
(<i>not</i> in top-boots, and not particularly prejudiced that
I know of), looking on as pretty a view out of my study
window as you will find in a long day's English ride. My
little place is a grave red brick house (time of George the
First, I suppose), which I have added to and stuck bits upon
in all manner of ways, so that it is as pleasantly irregular,
and as violently opposed to all architectural ideas, as the
most hopeful man could possibly desire. It is on the summit
of Gad's Hill. The robbery was committed before the door,
on the man with the treasure, and Falstaff ran away from
the identical spot of ground now covered by the room in
which I write. A little rustic alehouse, called The Sir
John Falstaff, is over the way&mdash;has been over the way,
ever since, in honour of the event. Cobham Woods and
Park are behind the house; the distant Thames in front;
the Medway, with Rochester, and its old castle and cathedral,
on one side. The whole stupendous property is on the old
Dover Road, so when you come, come by the North Kent
Railway (not the South-Eastern) to Strood or Higham, and
I'll drive over to fetch you.</p>

<p>The blessed woods and fields have done me a world of
good, and I am quite myself again. The children are all as
happy as children can be. My eldest daughter, Mary,
keeps house, with a state and gravity becoming that high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
position; wherein she is assisted by her sister Katie, and by
her aunt Georgina, who is, and always has been, like
another sister. Two big dogs, a bloodhound and a St.
Bernard, direct from a convent of that name, where I think
you once were, are their principal attendants in the green
lanes. These latter instantly untie the neckerchiefs of all
tramps and prowlers who approach their presence, so that
they wander about without any escort, and drive big horses
in basket-phaetons through murderous bye-ways, and never
come to grief. They are very curious about your daughters,
and send all kinds of loves to them and to Mrs. Cerjat, in
which I heartily join.</p>

<p>You will have read in the papers that the Thames in
London is most horrible. I have to cross Waterloo or
London Bridge to get to the railroad when I come down
here, and I can certify that the offensive smells, even in
that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending
nature. Nobody knows what is to be done; at
least everybody knows a plan, and everybody else knows it
won't do; in the meantime cartloads of chloride of lime
are shot into the filthy stream, and do something I hope.
You will know, before you get this, that the American telegraph
line has parted again, at which most men are sorry,
but very few surprised. This is all the news, except that
there is an Italian Opera at Drury Lane, price eighteenpence
to the pit, where Viardot, by far the greatest artist
of them all, sings, and which is full when the dear opera
can't let a box; and except that the weather has been
exceptionally hot, but is now quite cool. On the top of
this hill it has been cold, actually cold at night, for more
than a week past.</p>

<p>I am going over to Rochester to post this letter, and
must write another to Townshend before I go. My dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Cerjat, I have written lightly enough, because I want you
to know that I am becoming cheerful and hearty. God
bless you! I love you, and I know that you love me.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>I received your letter this morning with the greatest
pleasure, and read it with the utmost interest in all its
domestic details.</p>

<p>We had a most wonderful night at Exeter. It is to be
regretted that we cannot take the place again on our way
back. It was a prodigious cram, and we turned away no
end of people. But not only that, I think they were the
finest audience I have ever read to. I don't think I ever
read, in some respects, so well; and I never beheld anything
like the personal affection which they poured out
upon me at the end. It was really a very remarkable sight,
and I shall always look back upon it with pleasure.</p>

<p>Last night here was not so bright. There are quarrels
of the strangest kind between the Plymouth people and the
Stonehouse people. The room is at Stonehouse (Tracy
says the wrong room; there being a Plymouth room in this
hotel, and he being a Plymouthite). We had a fair house,
but not at all a great one. All the notabilities come this
morning to "Little Dombey," for which we have let one
hundred and thirty stalls, which local admiration of local
greatness considers very large. For "Mrs. Gamp and the
Boots," to-night, we have also a very promising let. But
the races are on, and there are two public balls to-night,
and the yacht squadron are all at Cherbourg to boot.
Arthur is of opinion that "Two Sixties" will do very well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for us. I doubt the "Two Sixties" myself. <i>Mais nous
verrons.</i></p>

<p>The room is a very handsome one, but it is on the top
of a windy and muddy hill, leading (literally) to nowhere;
and it looks (except that it is new and <i>mortary</i>) as if the
subsidence of the waters after the Deluge might have left
it where it is. I have to go right through the company to
get to the platform. Big doors slam and resound when
anybody comes in; and all the company seem afraid of one
another. Nevertheless they were a sensible audience last
night, and much impressed and pleased.</p>

<p>Tracy is in the room (wandering about, and never
finishing a sentence), and sends all manner of sea-loves to
you and the dear girls. I send all manner of land-loves to
you from myself, out of my heart of hearts, and also to my
dear Plorn and the boys.</p>

<p>Arthur sends his kindest love. He knows only two
characters. He is either always corresponding, like a
Secretary of State, or he is transformed into a rout-furniture
dealer of Rathbone Place, and drags forms about
with the greatest violence, without his coat.</p>

<p>I have no time to add another word.</p>

</div>

<p>A wonderful audience last night at Wolverhampton.
If such a thing can be, they were even quicker and more
intelligent than the audience I had in Edinburgh. They
were so wonderfully good and were so much on the alert
this morning by nine o'clock for another reading, that we
are going back there at about our Bradford time. I never
saw such people. And the local agent would take no
money, and charge no expenses of his own.</p>

<p>This place looks what Plorn would call "ortily" dull.
Local agent predicts, however, "great satisfaction to
Mr. Dickens, and excellent attendance." I have just been
to look at the hall, where everything was wrong, and where
I have left Arthur making a platform for me out of dining-tables.</p>

<p>If he comes back in time, I am not quite sure but that
he is himself going to write to Gad's Hill. We talk of
coming up from Chester <i>in the night to-morrow, after the
reading;</i> and of showing our precious selves at an apparently
impossibly early hour in the Gad's Hill breakfast-room
on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>I have not felt the fatigue to any extent worth mentioning;
though I get, every night, into the most violent
heats. We are going to dine at three o'clock (it wants a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
quarter now) and have not been here two hours, so I have
seen nothing of Clement.</p>

<p>Tell Georgy with my love, that I read in the same room
in which we acted, but at the end opposite to that where
our stage was. We are not at the inn where the amateur
company put up, but at The Lion, where the fair Miss
Mitchell was lodged alone. We have the strangest little
rooms (sitting-room and two bed-rooms all together), the
ceilings of which I can touch with my hand. The windows
bulge out over the street, as if they were little stern-windows
in a ship. And a door opens out of the sitting-room
on to a little open gallery with plants in it, where one
leans over a queer old rail, and looks all downhill and slant-wise
at the crookedest black and yellow old houses, all
manner of shapes except straight shapes. To get into this
room we come through a china closet; and the man in
laying the cloth has actually knocked down, in that repository,
two geraniums and Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p>I think that's all I have to say, except that at the
Wolverhampton theatre they played "Oliver Twist" last
night (Mr. Toole the Artful Dodger), "in consequence of
the illustrious author honouring the town with his presence."
We heard that the device succeeded very well, and that they
got a good many people.</p>

<p>John's spirits have been equable and good since we
rejoined him. Berry has always got something the matter
with his digestion&mdash;seems to me the male gender of Maria
Jolly, and ought to take nothing but Revalenta Arabica.
Bottled ale is not to be got in these parts, and Arthur is
thrown upon draught.</p>

<p>My dearest love to Georgy and to Katey, also to
Marguerite. Also to all the boys and the noble Plorn.</p>

<span class="smcap">Morrison's Hotel, Dublin</span>, <i>Monday, Aug. 23rd, 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<p>We had a nasty crossing here. We left Holyhead
at one in the morning, and got here at six. Arthur was
incessantly sick the whole way. I was not sick at all, but
was in as healthy a condition otherwise as humanity need
be. We are in a beautiful hotel. Our sitting-room is
exactly like the drawing-room at the Peschiere in all its
dimensions. I never saw two rooms so exactly resembling
one another in their proportions. Our bedrooms too are
excellent, and there are baths and all sorts of comforts.</p>

<p>The Lord Lieutenant is away, and the place looks to me
as if its professional life were away too. Nevertheless,
there are numbers of people in the streets. Somehow, I
hardly seem to think we are going to do enormously here;
but I have scarcely any reason for supposing so (except
that a good many houses are shut up); and I <i>know</i> nothing
about it, for Arthur is now gone to the agent and to the
room. The men came by boat direct from Liverpool. They
had a rough passage, were all ill, and did not get here till
noon yesterday. Donnybrook Fair, or what remains of it,
is going on, within two or three miles of Dublin. They
went out there yesterday in a jaunting-car, and John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
described it to us at dinner-time (with his eyebrows lifted
up, and his legs well asunder), as "Johnny Brooks's Fair;"
at which Arthur, who was drinking bitter ale, nearly
laughed himself to death. Berry is always unfortunate,
and when I asked what had happened to Berry on board
the steamboat, it appeared that "an Irish gentleman which
was drunk, and fancied himself the captain, wanted to
knock Berry down."</p>

<p>I am surprised by finding this place very much larger
than I had supposed it to be. Its bye-parts are bad enough,
but cleaner, too, than I had supposed them to be, and certainly
very much cleaner than the old town of Edinburgh.
The man who drove our jaunting-car yesterday hadn't a
piece in his coat as big as a penny roll, and had had his hat
on (apparently without brushing it) ever since he was grown
up. But he was remarkably intelligent and agreeable, with
something to say about everything. For instance, when I
asked him what a certain building was, he didn't say "courts
of law" and nothing else, but: "Av you plase, sir, it's the
foor coorts o' looyers, where Misther O'Connell stood his
trial wunst, ye'll remimber, sir, afore I tell ye of it." When
we got into the Ph&oelig;nix Park, he looked round him as if it
were his own, and said: "<span class="smcap">That's</span> a park, sir, av yer plase."
I complimented it, and he said: "Gintlemen tills me as
they'r bin, sir, over Europe, and never see a park aqualling
ov it. 'Tis eight mile roond, sir, ten mile and a half long,
and in the month of May the hawthorn trees are as beautiful
as brides with their white jewels on. Yonder's the vice-regal
lodge, sir; in them two corners lives the two sicretirries,
wishing I was them, sir. There's air here, sir, av
yer plase! There's scenery here, sir! There's mountains&mdash;thim,
sir! Yer coonsider it a park, sir? It is that, sir!"</p>

<p>You should have heard John in my bedroom this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
morning endeavouring to imitate a bath-man, who had resented
his interference, and had said as to the shower-bath:
"Yer'll not be touching <i>that</i>, young man. Divil a touch
yer'll touch o' that insthrument, young man!" It was
more ridiculously unlike the reality than I can express to
you, yet he was so delighted with his powers that he went
off in the absurdest little gingerbeery giggle, backing into
my portmanteau all the time.</p>

<p>My dear love to Katie and to Georgy, also to the noble
Plorn and all the boys. I shall write to Katie next, and
then to Aunty. My cold, I am happy to report, is very
much better. I lay in the wet all night on deck, on board
the boat, but am not as yet any the worse for it. Arthur
was quite insensible when we got to Dublin, and stared at
our luggage without in the least offering to claim it. He
left his kindest love for all before he went out. I will keep
the envelope open until he comes in.</p>

<span class="smcap">Morrison's Hotel, Dublin</span>, <i>Wednesday, Aug. 25th, 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I begin my letter to you to-day, though I don't know
when I may send it off. We had a very good house last
night, after all, that is to say, a great rush of shillings
and good half-crowns, though the stalls were comparatively
few. For "Little Dombey," this morning, we have an
immense stall let&mdash;already more than two hundred&mdash;and
people are now fighting in the agent's shop to take more.
Through some mistake of our printer's, the evening reading
for this present Wednesday was dropped, in a great part of
the announcements, and the agent opened no plan for it. I
have therefore resolved not to have it at all. Arthur Smith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
has waylaid me in all manner of ways, but I remain obdurate.
I am frightfully tired, and really relieved by the prospect
of an evening&mdash;overjoyed.</p>

<p>They were a highly excitable audience last night, but
they certainly did not comprehend&mdash;internally and intellectually
comprehend&mdash;"The Chimes" as a London audience
do. I am quite sure of it. I very much doubt the Irish
capacity of receiving the pathetic; but of their quickness as
to the humorous there can be no doubt. I shall see how
they go along with Little Paul, in his death, presently.</p>

<p>While I was at breakfast this morning, a general officer
was announced with great state&mdash;having a staff at the door&mdash;and
came in, booted and plumed, and covered with Crimean
decorations. It was Cunninghame, whom we knew in Genoa&mdash;then
a captain. He was very hearty indeed, and came to
ask me to dinner. Of course I couldn't go. Olliffe has a
brother at Cork, who has just now (noon) written to me,
proposing dinners and excursions in that neighbourhood
which would fill about a week; I being there a day and a
half, and reading three times. The work will be very severe
here, and I begin to feel depressed by it. (By "here," I
mean Ireland generally, please to observe.)</p>

<p>We meant, as I said in a letter to Katie, to go to
Queenstown yesterday and bask on the seashore. But
there is always so much to do that we couldn't manage it
after all. We expect a tremendous house to-morrow night
as well as to-day; and Arthur is at the present instant up
to his eyes in business (and seats), and, between his regret
at losing to-night, and his desire to make the room hold
twice as many as it <i>will</i> hold, is half distracted. I have
become a wonderful Irishman&mdash;must play an Irish part
some day&mdash;and his only relaxation is when I enact "John
and the Boots," which I consequently do enact all day long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The papers are full of remarks upon my white tie, and
describe it as being of enormous size, which is a wonderful
delusion, because, as you very well know, it is a small tie.
Generally, I am happy to report, the Emerald press is in
favour of my appearance, and likes my eyes. But one
gentleman comes out with a letter at Cork, wherein he says
that although only forty-six I look like an old man. <i>He</i> is
a rum customer, I think.</p>

<p>The Rutherfords are living here, and wanted me to dine
with them, which, I needn't say, could not be done; all
manner of people have called, but I have seen only two.
John has given it up altogether as to rivalry with the
Boots, and did not come into my room this morning at all.
Boots appeared triumphant and alone. He was waiting for
me at the hotel-door last night. "Whaa't sart of a hoose,
sur?" he asked me. "Capital." "The Lard be praised
fur the 'onor o' Dooblin!"</p>

<p>Arthur buys bad apples in the streets and brings them
home and doesn't eat them, and then I am obliged to put
them in the balcony because they make the room smell
faint. Also he meets countrymen with honeycomb on their
heads, and leads them (by the buttonhole when they have
one) to this gorgeous establishment and requests the bar to
buy honeycomb for his breakfast; then it stands upon the
sideboard uncovered and the flies fall into it. He buys
owls, too, and castles, and other horrible objects, made in
bog-oak (that material which is not appreciated at Gad's
Hill); and he is perpetually snipping pieces out of newspapers
and sending them all over the world. While I am
reading he conducts the correspondence, and his great
delight is to show me seventeen or eighteen letters when I
come, exhausted, into the retiring-place. Berry has not
got into any particular trouble for forty-eight hours, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that he is all over boils. I have prescribed the yeast, but
ineffectually. It is indeed a sight to see him and John
sitting in pay-boxes, and surveying Ireland out of pigeon-holes.</p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Same Evening before Bed-time.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Everybody was at "Little Dombey" to-day, and
although I had some little difficulty to work them up
in consequence of the excessive crowding of the place, and
the difficulty of shaking the people into their seats, the
effect was unmistakable and profound. The crying was
universal, and they were extraordinarily affected. There is
no doubt we could stay here a week with that one reading,
and fill the place every night. Hundreds of people have
been there to-night, under the impression that it would come
off again. It was a most decided and complete success.</p>

<p>Arthur has been imploring me to stop here on the Friday
after Limerick, and read "Little Dombey" again. But I
have positively said "No." The work is too hard. It is
not like doing it in one easy room, and always the same
room. With a different place every night, and a different
audience with its own peculiarity every night, it is a
tremendous strain. I was sick of it to-day before I began,
then got myself into wonderful train.</p>

<p>Here follows a dialogue (but it requires imitation), which
I had yesterday morning with a little boy of the house&mdash;landlord's
son, I suppose&mdash;about Plorn's age. I am sitting
on the sofa writing, and find him sitting beside me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Inimitable.</span> Holloa, old chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Ireland.</span> Hal-loo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inimitable.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Ireland.</span> Dat was me!</p></div>

<p>There are two stupid old louts at the room, to show
people into their places, whom John calls "them two old
Paddies," and of whom he says, that he "never see nothing
like them (snigger) hold idiots" (snigger). They bow and
walk backwards before the grandees, and our men hustle
them while they are doing it.</p>

<p>We walked out last night, with the intention of going
to the theatre; but the Piccolomini establishment (they were
doing the "Lucia") looked so horribly like a very bad jail,
and the Queen's looked so blackguardly, that we came back
again, and went to bed. I seem to be always either in a
railway carriage, or reading, or going to bed. I get so
knocked up, whenever I have a minute to remember it, that
then I go to bed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>I send my love to the noble Plorn, and to all the boys.
To dear Mamie and Katie, and to yourself of course, in the
first degree. I am looking forward to the last Irish reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on Thursday, with great impatience. But when we shall
have turned this week, once knocked off Belfast, I shall see
land, and shall (like poor Timber in the days of old) "keep
up a good heart." I get so wonderfully hot every night in
my dress clothes, that they positively won't dry in the short
interval they get, and I have been obliged to write to
Doudney's to make me another suit, that I may have a
constant change.</p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Belfast</span>, <i>Saturday, Aug. 28th, 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<p>When I went down to the Rotunda at Dublin on Thursday
night, I said to Arthur, who came rushing at me: "You
needn't tell me. I know all about it." The moment I had
come out of the door of the hotel (a mile off), I had come
against the stream of people turned away. I had struggled
against it to the room. There, the crowd in all the lobbies
and passages was so great, that I had a difficulty in getting
in. They had broken all the glass in the pay-boxes. They
had offered frantic prices for stalls. Eleven bank-notes were
thrust into that pay-box (Arthur saw them) at one time, for
eleven stalls. Our men were flattened against walls, and
squeezed against beams. Ladies stood all night with their
chins against my platform. Other ladies sat all night upon
my steps. You never saw such a sight. And the reading
went tremendously! It is much to be regretted that we
troubled ourselves to go anywhere else in Ireland. We
turned away people enough to make immense houses for a
week.</p>

<p>We arrived here yesterday at two. The room will not
hold more than from eighty to ninety pounds. The same
scene was repeated with the additional feature, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
people are much rougher here than in Dublin, and that there
was a very great uproar at the opening of the doors, which,
the police in attendance being quite inefficient and only looking
on, it was impossible to check. Arthur was in the
deepest misery because shillings got into stalls, and half-crowns
got into shillings, and stalls got nowhere, and there
was immense confusion. It ceased, however, the moment I
showed myself; and all went most brilliantly, in spite of a
great piece of the cornice of the ceiling falling with a great
crash within four or five inches of the head of a young lady
on my platform (I was obliged to have people there), and in
spite of my gas suddenly going out at the time of the game
of forfeits at Scrooge's nephew's, through some Belfastian
gentleman accidentally treading on the flexible pipe, and
needing to be relighted.</p>

<p>We shall not get to Cork before mid-day on Monday; it
being difficult to get from here on a Sunday. We hope to
be able to start away to-morrow morning to see the Giant's
Causeway (some sixteen miles off), and in that case we shall
sleep at Dublin to-morrow night, leaving here by the train
at half-past three in the afternoon. Dublin, you must
understand, is on the way to Cork. This is a fine place,
surrounded by lofty hills. The streets are very wide, and
the place is very prosperous. The whole ride from Dublin
here is through a very picturesque and various country;
and the amazing thing is, that it is all particularly neat and
orderly, and that the houses (outside at all events) are all
brightly whitewashed and remarkably clean. I want to
climb one of the neighbouring hills before this morning's
"Dombey." I am now waiting for Arthur, who has gone
to the bank to remit his last accumulation of treasure to
London.</p>

<p>Our men are rather indignant with the Irish crowds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
because in the struggle they don't sell books, and because,
in the pressure, they can't force a way into the room afterwards
to sell them. They are deeply interested in the
success, however, and are as zealous and ardent as possible.
I shall write to Katie next. Give her my best love, and kiss
the darling Plorn for me, and give my love to all the boys.</p>

Hogarth.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Morrison's Hotel, Dublin,</span> <i>Sunday Night, Aug. 29th, 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I am so delighted to find your letter here to-night
(eleven o'clock), and so afraid that, in the wear and tear of
this strange life, I have written to Gad's Hill in the wrong
order, and have not written to you, as I should, that I
resolve to write this before going to bed. You will find it
a wretchedly stupid letter; but you may imagine, my
dearest girl, that I am tired.</p>

<p>The success at Belfast has been equal to the success
here. Enormous! We turned away half the town. I
think them a better audience, on the whole, than Dublin;
and the personal affection there was something overwhelming.
I wish you and the dear girls could have seen the
people look at me in the street; or heard them ask me, as I
hurried to the hotel after reading last night, to "do me the
honour to shake hands, Misther Dickens, and God bless you,
sir; not ounly for the light you've been to me this night,
but for the light you've been in mee house, sir (and God
love your face), this many a year." Every night, by-the-bye,
since I have been in Ireland, the ladies have beguiled
John out of the bouquet from my coat. And yesterday
morning, as I had showered the leaves from my geranium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in reading "Little Dombey," they mounted the platform,
after I was gone, and picked them all up as keepsakes!</p>

<p>I have never seen <i>men</i> go in to cry so undisguisedly as
they did at that reading yesterday afternoon. They made
no attempt whatever to hide it, and certainly cried more
than the women. As to the "Boots" at night, and
"Mrs. Gamp" too, it was just one roar with me and them;
for they made me laugh so that sometimes I <i>could not</i>
compose my face to go on.</p>

<p>You must not let the new idea of poor dear Landor efface
the former image of the fine old man. I wouldn't blot him
out, in his tender gallantry, as he sat upon that bed at
Forster's that night, for a million of wild mistakes at eighty
years of age.</p>

<p>I hope to be at Tavistock House before five o'clock next
Saturday morning, and to lie in bed half the day, and
come home by the 10.50 on Sunday.</p>

<p>Tell the girls that Arthur and I have each ordered at
Belfast a trim, sparkling, slap-up <i>Irish jaunting-car!!!</i> I
flatter myself we shall astonish the Kentish people. It is
the oddest carriage in the world, and you are always falling
off. But it is gay and bright in the highest degree.
Wonderfully Neapolitan.</p>

<p>What with a sixteen mile ride before we left Belfast,
and a sea-beach walk, and a two o'clock dinner, and a seven
hours' railway ride since, I am&mdash;as we say here&mdash;"a thrifle
weary." But I really am in wonderful force, considering
the work. For which I am, as I ought to be, very thankful.</p>

<p>Arthur was exceedingly unwell last night&mdash;could not
cheer up at all. He was so very unwell that he left the
hall(!) and became invisible after my five minutes' rest.
I found him at the hotel in a jacket and slippers, and with
a hot bath just ready. He was in the last stage of prostration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The local agent was with me, and proposed that he
(the wretched Arthur) should go to his office and balance
the accounts then and there. He went, in the jacket and
slippers, and came back in twenty minutes, <i>perfectly well</i>,
in consequence of the admirable balance. He is now
sitting opposite to me <span class="smcap">on the bag of silver</span>, forty pounds
(it must be dreadfully hard), writing to Boulogne.</p>

<p>I suppose it is clear that the next letter I write is
Katie's. Either from Cork or from Limerick, it shall report
further. At Limerick I read in the theatre, there being no
other place.</p>

<p>Best love to Mamie and Katie, and dear Plorn, and all
the boys left when this comes to Gad's Hill; also to my
dear good Anne, and her little woman.</p>

<i>Monday, Sept. 6th, 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wilkie</span>,</div>

<p>First, let me report myself here for something less
than eight-and-forty hours. I come last (and direct&mdash;a
pretty hard journey) from Limerick. The success in Ireland
has been immense.</p>

<p>The work is very hard, sometimes overpowering; but I
am none the worse for it, and arrived here quite fresh.</p>

<p>Secondly, will you let me recommend the enclosed letter
from Wigan, as the groundwork of a capital article, in your
way, for H. W.? There is not the least objection to a plain
reference to him, or to Phelps, to whom the same thing
happened a year or two ago, near Islington, in the case of
a clever and capital little daughter of his. I think it a
capital opportunity for a discourse on gentility, with a
glance at those other schools which advertise that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"sons of gentlemen only" are admitted, and a just recognition
of the greater liberality of our public schools. There
are tradesmen's sons at Eton, and Charles Kean was at
Eton, and Macready (also an actor's son) was at Rugby.
Some such title as "Scholastic Flunkeydom," or anything
infinitely contemptuous, would help out the meaning.
Surely such a schoolmaster must swallow all the silver forks
that the pupils are expected to take when they come, and
are not expected to take away with them when they go.
And of course he could not exist, unless he had flunkey
customers by the dozen.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;no, this is thirdly now&mdash;about the Christmas
number. I have arranged so to stop my readings, as to be
available for it on <i>the 15th of November</i>, which will leave
me time to write a good article, if I clear my way to one.
Do you see your way to our making a Christmas number of
this idea that I am going very briefly to hint? Some disappointed
person, man or woman, prematurely disgusted
with the world, for some reason or no reason (the person
should be young, I think) retires to an old lonely house,
or an old lonely mill, or anything you like, with one
attendant, resolved to shut out the world, and hold no
communion with it. The one attendant sees the absurdity
of the idea, pretends to humour it, but really thus to
slaughter it. Everything that happens, everybody that
comes near, every breath of human interest that floats into
the old place from the village, or the heath, or the four
cross-roads near which it stands, and from which belated
travellers stray into it, shows beyond mistake that you can't
shut out the world; that you are in it, to be of it; that you
get into a false position the moment you try to sever yourself
from it; and that you must mingle with it, and make the
best of it, and make the best of yourself into the bargain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>If we could plot out a way of doing this together, I would
not be afraid to take my part. If we could not, could we
plot out a way of doing it, and taking in stories by other
hands? If we could not do either (but I think we could),
shall we fall back upon a round of stories again? That I
would rather not do, if possible. Will you think about it?</p>

<p>And can you come and dine at Tavistock House <i>on
Monday, the 20th September, at half-past five?</i> I purpose
being at home there with the girls that day.</p>

<p>Answer this, according to my printed list for the week.
I am off to Huddersfield on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>I think I will now leave off; merely adding that I have
got a splendid brogue (it really is exactly like the people),
and that I think of coming out as the only legitimate
successor of poor Power.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>We had a very fine house indeed at York. All
kinds of applications have been made for another reading
there, and no doubt it would be exceedingly productive;
but it cannot be done. At Harrogate yesterday; the
queerest place, with the strangest people in it, leading the
oddest lives of dancing, newspaper reading, and tables
d'h&ocirc;te. The piety of York obliging us to leave that place
for this at six this morning, and there being no night
train from Harrogate, we had to engage a special engine.
We got to bed at one, and were up again before five;
which, after yesterday's fatigues, leaves me a little worn
out at this present.</p>

<p>I have no accounts of this place as yet, nor have I
received any letter here. But the post of this morning is
not yet delivered, I believe. We have a charming room,
overlooking the sea. Leech is here (living within a few
doors), with the partner of his bosom, and his young family.
I write at ten in the morning, having been here two hours;
and you will readily suppose that I have not seen him.</p>

<p>Of news, I have not the faintest breath. I seem to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
been doing nothing all my life but riding in railway-carriages
and reading. The railway of the morning brought
us through Castle Howard, and under the woods of
Easthorpe, and then just below Malton Abbey, where I
went to poor Smithson's funeral. It was a most lovely
morning, and, tired as I was, I couldn't sleep for looking
out of window.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at Harrogate, two circumstances occurred
which gave Arthur great delight. Firstly, he chafed his
legs sore with his black bag of silver. Secondly, the landlord
asked him as a favour, "If he could oblige him with a
little silver." He obliged him directly with some forty
pounds' worth; and I suspect the landlord to have repented
of having approached the subject. After the reading last
night we walked over the moor to the railway, three miles,
leaving our men to follow with the luggage in a light cart.
They passed us just short of the railway, and John was
making the night hideous and terrifying the sleeping country,
by <i>playing the horn</i> in prodigiously horrible and unmusical
blasts.</p>

<p>My dearest love, of course, to the dear girls, and to the
noble Plorn. Apropos of children, there was one gentleman
at the "Little Dombey" yesterday morning, who exhibited,
or rather concealed, the profoundest grief. After crying a
good deal without hiding it, he covered his face with both
his hands, and laid it down on the back of the seat before
him, and really shook with emotion. He was not in mourning,
but I supposed him to have lost some child in old time.
There was a remarkably good fellow of thirty or so, too, who
found something so very ludicrous in "Toots," that he
<i>could not</i> compose himself at all, but laughed until he sat
wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. And whenever he
felt "Toots" coming again he began to laugh and wipe his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
eyes afresh, and when he came he gave a kind of cry, as if
it were too much for him. It was uncommonly droll, and
made me laugh heartily.</p>

<p>I have added a pound to the cheque. I would
recommend your seeing the poor railway man again and
giving him ten shillings, and telling him to let you see him
again in about a week. If he be then still unable to lift
weights and handle heavy things, I would then give him
another ten shillings, and so on.</p>

<p>Since I wrote to Georgy from Scarborough, we have
had, thank God, nothing but success. The Hull people
(not generally considered excitable, even on their own showing)
were so enthusiastic, that we were obliged to promise
to go back there for two readings. I have positively
resolved not to lengthen out the time of my tour, so we are
now arranging to drop some small places, and substitute
Hull again and York again. But you will perhaps have
heard this in the main from Arthur. I know he wrote to
you after the reading last night. This place I have
always doubted, knowing that we should come here when
it was recovering from the double excitement of the festival
and the Queen. But there is a very large hall let indeed,
and the prospect of to-night consequently looks bright.</p>

<p>Arthur told you, I suppose, that he had his shirt-front
and waistcoat torn off last night? He was perfectly
enraptured in consequence. Our men got so knocked
about that he gave them five shillings apiece on the spot.
John passed several minutes upside down against a wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with his head amongst the people's boots. He came out of
the difficulty in an exceedingly touzled condition, and with
his face much flushed. For all this, and their being packed
as you may conceive they would be packed, they settled
down the instant I went in, and never wavered in the
closest attention for an instant. It was a very high room,
and required a great effort.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I slept in this house three days last
year with Wilkie. Arthur has the bedroom I occupied
then, and I have one two doors from it, and Gordon
has the one between. Not only is he still with
us, but he <i>has</i> talked of going on to Manchester, going
on to London, and coming back with us to Darlington next
Tuesday!!!</p>

<p>These streets look like a great circus with the season
just finished. All sorts of garish triumphal arches were
put up for the Queen, and they have got smoky, and have
been looked out of countenance by the sun, and are
blistered and patchy, and half up and half down, and are
hideous to behold. Spiritless men (evidently drunk for
some time in the royal honour) are slowly removing them,
and on the whole it is more like the clearing away of "The
Frozen Deep" at Tavistock House than anything within your
knowledge&mdash;with the exception that we are not in the least
sorry, as we were then. Vague ideas are in Arthur's head
that when we come back to Hull, we are to come here, and
are to have the Town Hall (a beautiful building), and read
to the million. I can't say yet. That depends. I remember
that when I was here before (I came from Rockingham
to make a speech), I thought them a dull and slow audience.
I hope I may have been mistaken. I never saw better
audiences than the Yorkshire audiences generally.</p>

<p>I am so perpetually at work or asleep, that I have not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
scrap of news. I saw the Leech family at Scarboro', both in
my own house (that is to say, hotel) and in theirs. They
were not at either reading. Scarboro' is gay and pretty,
and I think Gordon had an idea that we were always at
some such place.</p>

<p>Kiss the darling Plorn for me, and give him my love;
dear Katie too, giving her the same. I feel sorry that I
cannot get down to Gad's Hill this next time, but I shall
look forward to our being there with Georgy, after Scotland.
Tell the servants that I remember them, and hope they will
live with us many years.</p>

<p>I write you a few lines to Tavistock House, thinking
you may not be sorry to find a note from me there on your
arrival from Gad's Hill.</p>

<p>Halifax was too small for us. I never saw such an
audience though. They were really worth reading to for
nothing, though I didn't do exactly that. It is as horrible
a place as I ever saw, I think.</p>

<p>The run upon the tickets here is so immense that Arthur
is obliged to get great bills out, signifying that no more can
be sold. It will be by no means easy to get into the place
the numbers who have already paid. It is the hall we acted
in. Crammed to the roof and the passages. We must come
back here towards the end of October, and are again altering
the list and striking out small places.</p>

<p>The trains are so strange and unintelligible in this part
of the country that we were obliged to leave Halifax at eight
this morning, and breakfast on the road&mdash;at Huddersfield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
again, where we had an hour's wait. Wills was in attendance
on the platform, and took me (here at Sheffield, I
mean) out to Frederick Lehmann's house to see Mrs. Wills.
She looked pretty much the same as ever, I thought, and
was taking care of a very pretty little boy. The house and
grounds are as nice as anything <i>can</i> be in this smoke. A
heavy thunderstorm is passing over the town, and it is raining
hard too.</p>

<p>This is a stupid letter, my dearest Georgy, but I write
in a hurry, and in the thunder and lightning, and with the
crowd of to-night before me.</p>

<div class='center'><small>EXTRACT.</small></div>

<p>The girls (as I have no doubt they have already told you
for themselves) arrived here in good time yesterday, and
in very fresh condition. They persisted in going to the
room last night, though I had arranged for their remaining
quiet.</p>

<p>We have done a vast deal here. I suppose you know
that we are going to Berwick, and that we mean to sleep
there and go on to Edinburgh on Monday morning, arriving
there before noon? If it be as fine to-morrow as it is
to-day, the girls will see the coast piece of railway between
Berwick and Edinburgh to great advantage. I was anxious
that they should, because that kind of pleasure is really
almost the only one they are likely to have in their present
trip.</p>

<p>Stanfield and Roberts are in Edinburgh, and the Scottish
Royal Academy gave them a dinner on Wednesday, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I was very pressingly invited. But, of course, my going was
impossible. I read twice that day.</p>

<p>Remembering what you do of Sunderland, you will be
surprised that our profit there was very considerable. I read
in a beautiful new theatre, and (I thought to myself) quite
wonderfully. Such an audience I never beheld for rapidity
and enthusiasm. The room in which we acted (converted
into a theatre afterwards) was burnt to the ground a year or
two ago. We found the hotel, so bad in our time, really
good. I walked from Durham to Sunderland, and from
Sunderland to Newcastle.</p>

<p>Don't you think, as we shall be at home at eleven in the
forenoon this day fortnight, that it will be best for you and
Plornish to come to Tavistock House for that Sunday, and
for us all to go down to Gad's Hill next day? My best love
to the noble Plornish. If he is quite reconciled to the postponement
of his trousers, I should like to behold his first
appearance in them. But, if not, as he is such a good
fellow, I think it would be a pity to disappoint and try him.</p>

<p>And now, my dearest Georgy, I think I have said all I
have to say before I go out for a little air. I had a very hard
day yesterday, and am tired.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Forster</span>,</div>

<p>As to the truth of the readings, I cannot tell you
what the demonstrations of personal regard and respect are.
How the densest and most uncomfortably-packed crowd
will be hushed in an instant when I show my face. How
the youth of colleges, and the old men of business in the
town, seem equally unable to get near enough to me when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they cheer me away at night. How common people and
gentlefolks will stop me in the streets and say: "Mr. Dickens,
will you let me touch the hand that has filled my home with
so many friends?" And if you saw the mothers, and fathers,
and sisters, and brothers in mourning, who invariably come
to "Little Dombey," and if you studied the wonderful
expression of comfort and reliance with which they hang
about me, as if I had been with them, all kindness and
delicacy, at their own little death-bed, you would think it
one of the strangest things in the world.</p>

<p>As to the mere effect, of course I don't go on doing the
thing so often without carefully observing myself and the
people too in every little thing, and without (in consequence)
greatly improving in it.</p>

<p>At Aberdeen, we were crammed to the street twice in
one day. At Perth (where I thought when I arrived there
literally could be nobody to come), the nobility came posting
in from thirty miles round, and the whole town came and
filled an immense hall. As to the effect, if you had seen them
after Lilian died, in "The Chimes," or when Scrooge woke and
talked to the boy outside the window, I doubt if you would
ever have forgotten it. And at the end of "Dombey"
yesterday afternoon, in the cold light of day, they all got
up, after a short pause, gentle and simple, and thundered
and waved their hats with that astonishing heartiness and
fondness for me, that for the first time in all my public
career they took me completely off my legs, and I saw the
whole eighteen hundred of them reel on one side as if a
shock from without had shaken the hall.</p>

<p>The dear girls have enjoyed themselves immensely, and
their trip has been a great success. I hope I told you (but
I forget whether I did or no) how splendidly Newcastle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
came out. I am reminded of Newcastle at the moment
because they joined me there.</p>

<p>I am anxious to get to the end of my readings, and to
be at home again, and able to sit down and think in my
own study. But the fatigue, though sometimes very great
indeed, hardly tells upon me at all. And although all our
people, from Smith downwards, have given in, more or less,
at times, I have never been in the least unequal to the
work, though sometimes sufficiently disinclined for it. My
kindest and best love to Mrs. Forster.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Mamie</span>,</div>

<p>I am writing in a very poor condition; I have a bad
cold all over me, pains in my back and limbs, and a very
sensitive and uncomfortable throat. There was a great
draught up some stone steps near me last night, and I
daresay that caused it.</p>

<p>The weather on my first two nights at Birmingham was
so intolerably bad&mdash;it blew hard, and never left off raining
for one single moment&mdash;that the houses were not what
they otherwise would have been. On the last night the
weather cleared, and we had a grand house.</p>

<p>Last night at Nottingham was almost, if not quite, the
most amazing we have had. It is not a very large place,
and the room is by no means a very large one, but three
hundred and twenty stalls were let, and all the other tickets
were sold.</p>

<p>Here we have two hundred and twenty stalls let for
to-night, and the other tickets are gone in proportion. It
is a pretty room, but not large.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>I have just been saying to Arthur that if there is not a
large let for York, I would rather give it up, and get
Monday at Gad's Hill. We have telegraphed to know. If
the answer comes (as I suppose it will) before post time, I
will tell you in a postscript what we decide to do. Coming
to London in the night of to-morrow (Saturday), and having
to see Mr. Ouvry on Sunday, and having to start for
York early on Monday, I fear I should not be able to get to
Gad's Hill at all. You won't expect me till you see me.</p>

<p>Arthur and I have considered Plornish's joke in all the
immense number of aspects in which it presents itself to
reflective minds. We have come to the conclusion that it is
the best joke ever made. Give the dear boy my love, and
the same to Georgy, and the same to Katey, and take the
same yourself. Arthur (excessively low and inarticulate)
mutters that he "unites."</p>

<p>[We knocked up Boylett, Berry, and John so frightfully
yesterday, by tearing the room to pieces and altogether
reversing it, as late as four o'clock, that we gave them a
supper last night. They shine all over to-day, as if it had
been entirely composed of grease.]</p>

</div>

<p>Little Leamington came out in the most amazing
manner yesterday&mdash;turned away hundreds upon hundreds
of people. They are represented as the dullest and worst
of audiences. I found them very good indeed, even in the
morning.</p>

<p>There awaited me at the hotel, a letter from the
Rev. Mr. Young, Wentworth Watson's tutor, saying that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Mrs. Watson wished her boy to shake hands with me, and that
he would bring him in the evening. I expected him at the
hotel before the readings. But he did not come. He spoke
to John about it in the room at night. The crowd and
confusion, however, were very great, and I saw nothing of
him. In his letter he said that Mrs. Watson was at Paris on
her way home, and would be at Brighton at the end of this
week. I suppose I shall see her there at the end of next
week.</p>

<p>We find a let of two hundred stalls here, which is very
large for this place. The evening being fine too, and blue
being to be seen in the sky beyond the smoke, we expect to
have a very full hall. Tell Mamey and Katey that if they
had been with us on the railway to-day between Leamington
and this place, they would have seen (though it is only an
hour and ten minutes by the express) fires and smoke
indeed. We came through a part of the Black Country that
you know, and it looked at its blackest. All the furnaces
seemed in full blast, and all the coal-pits to be working.</p>

<p>It is market-day here, and the ironmasters are standing
out in the street (where they always hold high change),
making such an iron hum and buzz, that they confuse me
horribly. In addition, there is a bellman announcing something&mdash;not
the readings, I beg to say&mdash;and there is an
excavation being made in the centre of the open place, for
a statue, or a pump, or a lamp-post, or something or other,
round which all the Wolverhampton boys are yelling and
struggling.</p>

<p>And here is Arthur, begging to have dinner at half-past
three instead of four, because he foresees "a wiry evening"
in store for him. Under which complication of distractions,
to which a waitress with a tray at this moment adds herself,
I sink, and leave off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>My best love to the dear girls, and to the noble Plorn,

<p>May I entreat you to thank Mr. Carter very

and, further, to explain to him that since my readings
began, I have known them to be incompatible with all
social enjoyments, and have neither set foot in a friend's
house nor sat down to a friend's table in any one of all the
many places I have been to, but have rigidly kept myself to
my hotels. To this resolution I must hold until the last.
There is not the least virtue in it. It is a matter of stern
necessity, and I submit with the worst grace possible.</p>

<p>Will you let me know, either at Southampton or Portsmouth,
whether any of you, and how many of you, if any,
are coming over, so that Arthur Smith may reserve good
seats? Tell Lotty I hope she does not contemplate coming
to the morning reading; I always hate it so myself.</p>

<p>Many thanks for these discourses. They are very
good, I think, as expressing what many men have felt and
thought; otherwise not specially remarkable. They have
one fatal mistake, which is a canker at the foot of their
ever being widely useful. Half the misery and hypocrisy
of the Christian world arises (as I take it) from a stubborn
determination to refuse the New Testament as a sufficient
guide in itself, and to force the Old Testament into alliance
with it&mdash;whereof comes all manner of camel-swallowing and
of gnat-straining. But so to resent this miserable error, or
to (by any implication) depreciate the divine goodness and
beauty of the New Testament, is to commit even a worse
error. And to class Jesus Christ with Mahomet is simply
audacity and folly. I might as well hoist myself on to a
high platform, to inform my disciples that the lives of King
George the Fourth and of King Alfred the Great belonged
to one and the same category.</p>

<h2>1859.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>During</span> the winter, Charles Dickens was living at Tavistock
House, removing to Gad's Hill for the summer early in
June, and returning to London in November. At this time
a change was made in his weekly journal. "Household
Words" became absolutely his own&mdash;Mr. Wills being his
partner and editor, as before&mdash;and was "incorporated with
'All the Year Round,'" under which title it was known
thenceforth. The office was still in Wellington Street, but
in a different house. The first number with the new name
appeared on the 30th April, and it contained the opening
of "A Tale of Two Cities."</div>

<p>The first letter which follows shows that a proposal for
a series of readings in America had already been made to
him. It was carefully considered and abandoned for the
time. But the proposal was constantly renewed, and the
idea never wholly relinquished for many years before he
actually decided on making so distant a "reading tour."</p>

<p>Mr. Procter contributed to the early numbers of "All
the Year Round" some very spirited "Songs of the Trades."
We give notes from Charles Dickens to the veteran poet,
both in the last year, and in this year, expressing his strong
approval of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter and two notes to Mr. (afterwards Sir Antonio)
Panizzi, for which we are indebted to Mr. Louis Fagan, one
of Sir A. Panizzi's executors, show the warm sympathy and
interest which he always felt for the cause of Italian liberty,
and for the sufferings of the State prisoners who at this
time took refuge in England.</p>

<p>We give a little note to the dear friend and companion of
Charles Dickens's daughters, "Lotty" White, because it is a
pretty specimen of his writing, and because the young girl,
who is playfully "commanded" to get well and strong, died
early in July of this year. She was, at the time this note was
written, first attacked with the illness which was fatal to all
her sisters. Mamie and Kate Dickens went from Gad's Hill
to Bonchurch to pay a last visit to their friend, and he writes
to his eldest daughter there. Also we give notes of loving
sympathy and condolence to the bereaved father and mother.</p>

<p>In the course of this summer Charles Dickens was not
well, and went for a week to his old favourite, Broadstairs&mdash;where
Mr. Wilkie Collins and his brother, Mr. Charles
Allston Collins, were staying&mdash;for sea-air and change, preparatory
to another reading tour, in England only. His
letter from Peterborough to Mr. Frank Stone, giving him
an account of a reading at Manchester (Mr. Stone's native
town), was one of the last ever addressed to that affectionate
friend, who died very suddenly, to the great grief of Charles
Dickens, in November. The letter to Mr. Thomas Longman,
which closes this year, was one of introduction to that
gentleman of young Marcus Stone, then just beginning his
career as an artist, and to whom the premature death of his
father made it doubly desirable that he should have powerful
helping hands.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens refers, in a letter to Mrs. Watson, to his
portrait by Mr. Frith, which was finished at the end of 1858.
It was painted for Mr. Forster, and is now in the "Forster
Collection" at South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The Christmas number of this year, again written by
several hands as well as his own, was "The Haunted
House." In November, his story of "A Tale of Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Cities" was finished in "All the Year Round," and in
December was published, complete, with dedication to Lord
John Russell.</p>

<p>Will you first read the enclosed letters, having previously
welcomed, with all possible cordiality, the bearer,
Mr. Thomas C. Evans, from New York?</p>

<p>You having read them, let me explain that Mr. Fields is
a highly respectable and influential man, one of the heads
of the most classical and most respected publishing house
in America; that Mr. Richard Grant White is a man of
high reputation; and that Felton is the Greek Professor in
their Cambridge University, perhaps the most distinguished
scholar in the States.</p>

<p>The address to myself, referred to in one of the letters,
being on its way, it is quite clear that I must give some
decided and definite answer to the American proposal.
Now, will you carefully discuss it with Mr. Evans before I
enter on it at all? Then, will you dine here with him on
Sunday&mdash;which I will propose to him&mdash;and arrange to meet
at half-past four for an hour's discussion?</p>

<p>The points are these:</p>

<p>First. I have a very grave question within myself
whether I could go to America at all.</p>

<p>Secondly. If I did go, I could not possibly go before
the autumn.</p>

<p>Thirdly. If I did go, how long must I stay?</p>

<p>Fourthly. If the stay were a short one, could <i>you</i> go?</p>

<p>Fifthly. What is his project? What could I make?
What occurs to you upon his proposal?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>I have told him that the business arrangements of the
readings have been from the first so entirely in your hands,
that I enter upon nothing connected with them without
previous reference to you.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>I received your always welcome annual with even
more interest than usual this year, being (in common with
my two girls and their aunt) much excited and pleased by
your account of your daughter's engagement. Apart from
the high sense I have of the affectionate confidence with
which you tell me what lies so tenderly on your own heart,
I have followed the little history with a lively sympathy and
regard for her. I hope, with you, that it is full of promise,
and that you will all be happy in it. The separation, even
in the present condition of travel (and no man can say how
much the discovery of a day may advance it), is nothing.
And so God bless her and all of you, and may the rosy
summer bring her all the fulness of joy that we all wish her.</p>

<p>To pass from the altar to Townshend (which is a long
way), let me report him severely treated by Bully, who
rules him with a paw of iron; and complaining, moreover,
of indigestion. He drives here every Sunday, but at all
other times is mostly shut up in his beautiful house, where
I occasionally go and dine with him <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and where
we always talk of you and drink to you. That is a rule
with us from which we never depart. He is "seeing a
volume of poems through the press;" rather an expensive
amusement. He has not been out at night (except to this
house) save last Friday, when he went to hear me read
"The Poor Traveller," "Mrs. Gamp," and "The Trial"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from "Pickwick." He came into my room at St. Martin's
Hall, and I fortified him with weak brandy-and-water.
You will be glad to hear that the said readings are a
greater <i>furore</i> than they ever have been, and that every
night on which they now take place&mdash;once a week&mdash;hundreds
go away, unable to get in, though the hall
holds thirteen hundred people. I dine with &mdash;&mdash; to-day,
by-the-bye, along with his agent; concerning whom I
observe him to be always divided between an unbounded
confidence and a little latent suspicion. He always tells me
that he is a gem of the first water; oh yes, the best of
business men! and then says that he did not quite like
his conduct respecting that farm-tenant and those hay-ricks.</p>

<p>There is a general impression here, among the best-informed,
that war in Italy, to begin with, is inevitable, and
will break out before April. I know a gentleman at Genoa
(Swiss by birth), deeply in with the authorities at Turin,
who is already sending children home.</p>

<p>In England we are quiet enough. There is a world of
talk, as you know, about Reform bills; but I don't believe
there is any general strong feeling on the subject. According
to my perceptions, it is undeniable that the public has
fallen into a state of indifference about public affairs, mainly
referable, as I think, to the people who administer them&mdash;and
there I mean the people of all parties&mdash;which is a very
bad sign of the times. The general mind seems weary of
debates and honourable members, and to have taken <i>laissez-aller</i>
for its motto.</p>

<p>My affairs domestic (which I know are not without their
interest for you) flow peacefully. My eldest daughter is a
capital housekeeper, heads the table gracefully, delegates
certain appropriate duties to her sister and her aunt, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
they are all three devotedly attached. Charley, my eldest
boy, remains in Barings' house. Your present correspondent
is more popular than he ever has been. I rather think that
the readings in the country have opened up a new public
who were outside before; but however that may be, his
books have a wider range than they ever had, and his public
welcomes are prodigious. Said correspondent is at present
overwhelmed with proposals to go and read in America.
Will never go, unless a small fortune be first paid down in
money on this side of the Atlantic. Stated the figure of
such payment, between ourselves, only yesterday. Expects
to hear no more of it, and assuredly will never go for less.
You don't say, my dear Cerjat, when you are coming to
England! Somehow I feel that this marriage ought to bring
you over, though I don't know why. You shall have a bed
here and a bed at Gad's Hill, and we will go and see strange
sights together. When I was in Ireland, I ordered the
brightest jaunting-car that ever was seen. It has just this
minute arrived per steamer from Belfast. Say you are
coming, and you shall be the first man turned over by it;
somebody must be (for my daughter Mary drives anything
that can be harnessed, and I know of no English horse that
would understand a jaunting-car coming down a Kentish
hill), and you shall be that somebody if you will. They
turned the basket-phaeton over, last summer, in a bye-road&mdash;Mary
and the other two&mdash;and had to get it up again;
which they did, and came home as if nothing had happened.
They send their loves to Mrs. Cerjat, and to you, and to
all, and particularly to the dear <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. So do I, with all
my heart, and am ever your attached and affectionate
friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Panizzi</span>,</div>

<p>If you should feel no delicacy in mentioning, or
should see no objection to mentioning, to Signor Poerio, or
any of the wronged Neapolitan gentlemen to whom it is
your happiness and honour to be a friend on their arrival in
this country, an idea that has occurred to me, I should
regard it as a great kindness in you if you would be my
exponent. I think you will have no difficulty in believing
that I would not, on any consideration, obtrude my name or
projects upon any one of those noble souls, if there were
any reason of the slightest kind against it. And if you see
any such reason, I pray you instantly to banish my letter
from your thoughts.</p>

<p>It seems to me probable that some narrative of their ten
years' suffering will, somehow or other, sooner or later, be
by some of them laid before the English people. The just
interest and indignation alive here, will (I suppose) elicit it.
False narratives and garbled stories will, in any case, of a
certainty get about. If the true history of the matter is to
be told, I have that sympathy with them and respect for
them which would, all other considerations apart, render it
unspeakably gratifying to me to be the means of its diffusion.
What I desire to lay before them is simply this. If
for my new successor to "Household Words" a narrative of
their ten years' trial could be written, I would take any
conceivable pains to have it rendered into English, and
presented in the sincerest and best way to a very large and
comprehensive audience. It should be published exactly as
you might think best for them, and remunerated in any way
that you might think generous and right. They want no
mouthpiece and no introducer, but perhaps they might have
no objection to be associated with an English writer, who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
possibly not unknown to them by some general reputation,
and who certainly would be animated by a strong public
and private respect for their honour, spirit, and unmerited
misfortunes. This is the whole matter; assuming that
such a thing is to be done, I long for the privilege of helping
to do it. These gentlemen might consider it an independent
means of making money, and I should be delighted
to pay the money.</p>

<p>In my absence from town, my friend and sub-editor,
Mr. Wills (to whom I had expressed my feeling on the
subject), has seen, I think, three of the gentlemen together.
But as I hear, returning home to-night, that they are in
your good hands, and as nobody can be a better judge than
you of anything that concerns them, I at once decide to
write to you and to take no other step whatever. Forgive
me for the trouble I have occasioned you in the reading of
this letter, and never think of it again if you think that by
pursuing it you would cause them an instant's uneasiness.</p>

<p>Had I not better send them all to the printer, and let

<p>1. I think that no one seeing the place can well
doubt that my house at Gad's Hill is the place for the
letter-box. The wall is accessible by all sorts and conditions
of men, on the bold high road, and the house
altogether is the great landmark of the whole neighbourhood.
Captain Goldsmith's <i>house</i> is up a lane considerably
off the high road; but he has a garden <i>wall</i> abutting on
the road itself.</p>

<p>2. "The Pic-Nic Papers" were originally sold to
Colburn, for the benefit of the widow of Mr. Macrone, of
St. James's Square, publisher, deceased. Two volumes
were contributed&mdash;of course gratuitously&mdash;by writers who
had had transactions with Macrone. Mr. Colburn, wanting
three volumes in all for trade purposes, added a third,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
consisting of an American reprint. Of that volume I didn't
know, and don't know, anything. The other two I edited,
gratuitously as aforesaid, and wrote the Lamplighter's story
in. It was all done many years ago. There was a preface
originally, delicately setting forth how the book came to be.</p>

<p>3. I suppose &mdash;&mdash; to be, as Mr. Samuel Weller expresses
it somewhere in "Pickwick," "ravin' mad with the consciousness
o' willany." Under their advertisement in <i>The

purporting to be addressed to the charitable by "Italian

tribute to "London's Lord Mayor," in grateful recognition

<p>You surprise me by supposing that there is ever
latent a defiant and roused expression in the undersigned
lamb! Apart from this singular delusion of yours, and
wholly unaccountable departure from your usual accuracy
in all things, your satisfaction with the portrait is a great
pleasure to me. It has received every conceivable pains at
Frith's hands, and ought on his account to be good. It is
a little too much (to my thinking) as if my next-door neighbour
were my deadly foe, uninsured, and I had just received
tidings of his house being afire; otherwise very good.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how delighted we shall be if you would
come to Gad's Hill. You should see some charming woods
and a rare old castle, and you should have such a snug
room looking over a Kentish prospect, with every facility
in it for pondering on the beauties of its master's beard!
<i>Do</i> come, but you positively <i>must not</i> come and go on the
same day.</p>

<p>We retreat there on Monday, and shall be there all the
summer.</p>

<p>My small boy is perfectly happy at Southsea, and likes
the school very much. I had the finest letter two or three
days ago, from another of my boys&mdash;Frank Jeffrey&mdash;at
Hamburg. In this wonderful epistle he says: "Dear papa,
I write to tell you that I have given up all thoughts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
being a doctor. My conviction that I shall never get over
my stammering is the cause; all professions are barred
against me. The only thing I should like to be is a gentleman
farmer, either at the Cape, in Canada, or Australia.
With my passage paid, fifteen pounds, a horse, and a rifle,
I could go two or three hundred miles up country, sow
grain, buy cattle, and in time be very comfortable."</p>

<p>Considering the consequences of executing the little
commission by the next steamer, I perceived that the first
consequence of the fifteen pounds would be that he would
be robbed of it&mdash;of the horse, that it would throw him&mdash;and
of the rifle, that it would blow his head off; which probabilities
I took the liberty of mentioning, as being against
the scheme. With best love from all,</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Mamie</span>,</div>

<p>On Saturday night I found, very much to my surprise
and pleasure, the photograph on my table at Tavistock
House. It is not a very pleasant or cheerful presentation
of my daughters; but it is wonderfully like for all that, and
in some details remarkably good. When I came home here
yesterday I tried it in the large Townshend stereoscope, in
which it shows to great advantage. It is in the little stereoscope
at present on the drawing-room table. One of the
balustrades of the destroyed old Rochester bridge has been
(very nicely) presented to me by the contractor for the
works, and has been duly stonemasoned and set up on the
lawn behind the house. I have ordered a sun-dial for the
top of it, and it will be a very good object indeed. The
Plorn is highly excited to-day by reason of an institution
which he tells me (after questioning George) is called the
"Cobb, or Bodderin," holding a festival at The Falstaff. He
is possessed of some vague information that they go to
Higham Church, in pursuance of some old usage, and
attend service there, and afterwards march round the village.
It so far looks probable that they certainly started off at
eleven very spare in numbers, and came back considerably
recruited, which looks to me like the difference between
going to church and coming to dinner. They bore no end
of bright banners and broad sashes, and had a band with a
terrific drum, and are now (at half-past two) dining at The
Falstaff, partly in the side room on the ground-floor, and
partly in a tent improvised this morning. The drum is
hung up to a tree in The Falstaff garden, and looks like a
tropical sort of gourd. I have presented the band with five
shillings, which munificence has been highly appreciated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Ices don't seem to be provided for the ladies in the gallery&mdash;I
mean the garden; they are prowling about there, endeavouring
to peep in at the beef and mutton through the
holes in the tent, on the whole, in a debased and degraded
manner.</p>

<p>Turk somehow cut his foot in Cobham Lanes yesterday,
and Linda hers. They are both lame, and looking at each
other. Fancy Mr. Townshend not intending to go for
another three weeks, and designing to come down here for
a few days&mdash;with Henri and Bully&mdash;on Wednesday! I wish
you could have seen him alone with me on Saturday; he
was so extraordinarily earnest and affectionate on my belongings
and affairs in general, and not least of all on you
and Katie, that he cried in a most pathetic manner, and was
so affected that I was obliged to leave him among the flowerpots
in the long passage at the end of the dining-room. It
was a very good piece of truthfulness and sincerity, especially
in one of his years, able to take life so easily.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wills are here now (but I daresay you
know it from your aunt), and return to town with me to-morrow
morning. We are now going on to the castle. Mrs.
Wills was very droll last night, and told me some good
stories. My dear, I wish particularly to impress upon you
and dear Katie (to whom I send my other best love) that I
hope your stay will not be very long. I don't think it very
good for either of you, though of course I know that Lotty
will be, and must be, and should be the first consideration
with you both. I am very anxious to know how you found
her and how you are yourself.</p>

<p>Best love to dear Lotty and Mrs. White. The same to
Mr. White and Clara. We are always talking about
you all.</p>

<div class='center'>
Heartily glad to get your letter this morning.<br />
</div>

<p>I cannot easily tell you how much interested I am by
what you tell me of our brave and excellent friend the
Chief Baron, in connection with that ruffian. I followed
the case with so much interest, and have followed the
miserable knaves and asses who have perverted it since,
with so much indignation, that I have often had more than
half a mind to write and thank the upright judge who tried
him. I declare to God that I believe such a service one of
the greatest that a man of intellect and courage can render
to society. Of course I saw the beast of a prisoner (with
my mind's eye) delivering his cut-and-dried speech, and
read in every word of it that no one but the murderer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>could have delivered or conceived it. Of course I have
been driving the girls out of their wits here, by incessantly
proclaiming that there needed no medical evidence either
way, and that the case was plain without it. Lastly, of
course (though a merciful man&mdash;because a merciful man I
mean), I would hang any Home Secretary (Whig, Tory,
Radical, or otherwise) who should step in between that
black scoundrel and the gallows. I can<i>not</i> believe&mdash;and my
belief in all wrong as to public matters is enormous&mdash;that
such a thing will be done.</p>

<p>I am reminded of Tennyson, by thinking that King
Arthur would have made short work of the amiable
&mdash;&mdash;, whom the newspapers strangely delight to make
a sort of gentleman of. How fine the "Idylls" are!
Lord! what a blessed thing it is to read a man who can
write! I thought nothing could be grander than the
first poem till I came to the third; but when I had read
the last, it seemed to be absolutely unapproached and
unapproachable.</p>

<p>To come to myself. I have written and begged the
"All the Year Round" publisher to send you directly four
weeks' proofs beyond the current number, that are in type.
I hope you will like them. Nothing but the interest of the
subject, and the pleasure of striving with the difficulty of
the forms of treatment, nothing in the mere way of money,
I mean, could also repay the time and trouble of the incessant
condensation. But I set myself the little task of
making a <i>picturesque</i> story, rising in every chapter with
characters true to nature, but whom the story itself should express,
more than they should express themselves, by dialogue.
I mean, in other words, that I fancied a story of incident
might be written, in place of the bestiality that <i>is</i> written
under that pretence, pounding the characters out in its own
mortar, and beating their own interests out of them. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you could have read the story all at once, I hope you
wouldn't have stopped halfway.</p>

<p>As to coming to your retreat, my dear Forster, think
how helpless I am. I am not well yet. I have an instinctive
feeling that nothing but the sea will restore me, and I
am planning to go and work at Ballard's, at Broadstairs,
from next Wednesday to Monday. I generally go to town
on Monday afternoon. All Tuesday I am at the office, on
Wednesday I come back here, and go to work again. I
don't leave off till Monday comes round once more. I am
fighting to get my story done by the first week in October.
On the 10th of October I am going away to read for a fortnight
at Ipswich, Norwich, Oxford, Cambridge, and a few
other places. Judge what my spare time is just now!</p>

<p>I am very much surprised and very sorry to find from
the enclosed that Elliotson has been ill. I never heard a
word of it.</p>

<p>Georgy sends best love to you and to Mrs. Forster, so
do I, so does Plorn, so does Frank. The girls are, for five
days, with the Whites at Ramsgate. It is raining, intensely
hot, and stormy. Eighteen creatures, like little tortoises,
have dashed in at the window and fallen on the paper since
I began this paragraph
<img src="images/ink.png" width="15" height="14" alt="ink-blot" title="ink-blot" /> (that was one!). I am a
wretched sort of creature in my way, but it is a way that
gets on somehow. And all ways have the same fingerpost
at the head of them, and at every turning in them.</p>

Tom Collin is of opinion that the Miss Dickenses has
growed two fine young women&mdash;leastwise, asking pardon,
ladies. An evangelical family of most disagreeable girls
prowl about here and trip people up with tracts, which they
put in the paths with stones upon them to keep them from
blowing away. Charles Collins and I having seen a bill

of which was set forth in the bill, in a line by itself, as</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">the rigid legs,</span><br />
</div>

<p>&mdash;were overpowered with curiosity, and resolved to go. It
came off in the Assembly Room, now more exquisitely
desolate than words can describe. Eighteen shillings was
the "take." Behind a screen among the company, we
heard mysterious gurglings of water before the entertainment
began, and then a slippery sound which occasioned
me to whisper C. C. (who laughed in the most ridiculous
manner), "Soap." It proved to be the young lady washing
herself. She must have been wonderfully dirty, for she
took a world of trouble, and didn't come out clean after all&mdash;in
a wretched dirty muslin frock, with blue ribbons. She
was the alleged mesmeriser, and a boy who distributed bills
the alleged mesmerised. It was a most preposterous imposition,
but more ludicrous than any poor sight I ever saw.
The boy is clearly out of pantomime, and when he pretended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to be in the mesmeric state, made the company back
by going in among them head over heels, backwards, half-a-dozen
times, in a most insupportable way. The pianist
had struck; and the manner in which the lecturer implored
"some lady" to play a "polker," and the manner in which
no lady would; and in which the few ladies who were there
sat with their hats on, and the elastic under their chins, as if
it were going to blow, is never to be forgotten. I have
been writing all the morning, and am going for a walk to
Ramsgate. This is a beast of a letter, but I am not well,
and have been addling my head.</p>

<p>Just a word to say that I have received yours, and
that I look forward to the reunion on Thursday, when I
hope to have the satisfaction of recounting to you the plot
of a play that has been laid before me for commending
advice.</p>

<p>Ditto to what you say respecting the <i>Great Eastern</i>. I
went right up to London Bridge by the boat that day, on
purpose that I might pass her. I thought her the ugliest
and most unshiplike thing these eyes ever beheld. I
wouldn't go to sea in her, shiver my ould timbers and
rouse me up with a monkey's tail (man-of-war metaphor),
not to chuck a biscuit into Davy Jones's weather eye, and
see double with my own old toplights.</p>

<p>Turk has been so good as to produce from his mouth,
for the wholesome consternation of the family, eighteen
feet of worm. When he had brought it up, he seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
think it might be turned to account in the housekeeping
and was proud. Pony has kicked a shaft off the cart, and
is to be sold. Why don't you buy her? she'd never kick
with you.</p>

<p>Barber's opinion is, that them fruit-trees, one and
all, is touchwood, and not fit for burning at any gentleman's
fire; also that the stocking of this here garden is
worth less than nothing, because you wouldn't have to
grub up nothing, and something takes a man to do it at
three-and-sixpence a day. Was "left desponding" by
your reporter.</p>

<p>I have had immense difficulty to find a man for the
stable-yard here. Barber having at last engaged one this
morning, I enquired if he had a decent hat for driving in,
to which Barber returned this answer:</p>

<p>"Why, sir, not to deceive you, that man flatly say that
he never have wore that article since man he was!"</p>

<p>I am consequently fortified into my room, and am afraid
to go out to look at him. Love from all.</p>

<p>You will receive by railway parcel the proof-sheets
of a story of mine, that has been for some time in progress
in my weekly journal, and that will be published in a complete
volume about the middle of November. Nobody but
Forster has yet seen the latter portions of it, or will see
them until they are published. I want you to read it for
two reasons. Firstly, because I hope it is the best story
I have written. Secondly, because it treats of a very
remarkable time in France; and I should very much like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to know what you think of its being dramatised for a
French theatre. If you should think it likely to be done,
I should be glad to take some steps towards having it well
done. The story is an extraordinary success here, and I
think the end of it is certain to make a still greater
sensation.</p>

<p>Don't trouble yourself to write to me, <i>mon ami</i>, until
you shall have had time to read the proofs. Remember,
they are <i>proofs</i>, and <i>private;</i> the latter chapters will not be
before the public for five or six weeks to come.</p>

<p>With kind regards to Madame Regnier, in which my
daughters and their aunt unite,</p>

<p>We had a splendid rush last night&mdash;exactly as we
supposed, with the pressure on the two shillings, of whom
we turned a crowd away. They were a far finer audience
than on the previous night; I think the finest I have ever
read to. They took every word of the "Dombey" in quite
an amazing manner, and after the child's death, paused a
little, and then set up a shout that it did one good to hear.
Mrs. Gamp then set in with a roar, which lasted until I
had done. I think everybody for the time forgot everything
but the matter in hand. It was as fine an instance of
thorough absorption in a fiction as any of us are likely to
see ever again.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; (in an exquisite red mantle), accompanied by her
sister (in another exquisite red mantle) and by the deaf lady,
(who leaned a black head-dress, exactly like an old-fashioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tea-urn without the top, against the wall), was charming.
HE couldn't get at her on account of the pressure. HE
tried to peep at her from the side door, but she (ha, ha, ha!)
was unconscious of his presence. I read to her, and goaded
him to madness. He is just sane enough to send his kindest
regards.</p>

<p>This is a place which&mdash;except the cathedral, with the
loveliest front I ever saw&mdash;is like the back door to some
other place. It is, I should hope, the deadest and most
utterly inert little town in the British dominions. The
magnates have taken places, and the bookseller is of
opinion that "such is the determination to do honour to
Mr. Dickens, that the doors <i>must</i> be opened half an hour
before the appointed time." You will picture to yourself
Arthur's quiet indignation at this, and the manner in which
he remarked to me at dinner, "that he turned away twice
Peterborough last night."</p>

<p>A very pretty room&mdash;though a Corn Exchange&mdash;and a
room we should have been glad of at Cambridge, as it is
large, bright, and cheerful, and wonderfully well lighted.</p>

<p>The difficulty of getting to Bradford from here to-morrow,
at any time convenient to us, turned out to be so great,
that we are all going in for Leeds (only three-quarters of an
hour from Bradford) to-night after the reading, at a quarter-past
eleven. We are due at Leeds a quarter before three.</p>

<p>So no more at present from,</p>

<p>I send you ten thousand thanks for your kind and
explicit letter. What I particularly wished to ascertain from
you was, whether it is likely the Censor would allow such a
piece to be played in Paris. In the case of its being likely,
then I wished to have the piece as well done as possible, and
would even have proposed to come to Paris to see it rehearsed.
But I very much doubted whether the general
subject would not be objectionable to the Government, and
what you write with so much sagacity and with such care
convinces me at once that its representation would be prohibited.
Therefore I altogether abandon and relinquish the
idea. But I am just as heartily and cordially obliged to you
for your interest and friendship, as if the book had been
turned into a play five hundred times. I again thank you
ten thousand times, and am quite sure that you are right.
I only hope you will forgive my causing you so much trouble,
after your hard work.</p>

<p>My girls and Georgina send their kindest regards to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Madame Regnier and to you. My Gad's Hill house (I
think I omitted to tell you, in reply to your enquiry) is on
the very scene of Falstaff's robbery. There is a little
<i>cabaret</i> at the roadside, still called The Sir John Falstaff.
And the country, in all its general features, is, at this time,
what it was in Shakespeare's. I hope you will see the
house before long. It is really a pretty place, and a good
residence for an English writer, is it not?</p>

<p>Macready, we are all happy to hear from himself, is
going to leave the dreary tomb in which he lives, at
Sherborne, and to remove to Cheltenham, a large and
handsome place, about four or five hours' railway journey
from London, where his poor girls will at least see and
hear some life. Madame C&eacute;leste was with me yesterday,
wishing to dramatise "A Tale of Two Cities" for the
Lyceum, after bringing out the Christmas pantomime. I
gave her my permission and the book; but I fear that her

<h2>1860.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>This</span> winter was the last spent at Tavistock House. Charles
Dickens had for some time been inclining to the idea of
making his home altogether at Gad's Hill, giving up his
London house, and taking a furnished house for the sake of
his daughters for a few months of the London season. And,
as his daughter Kate was to be married this summer to
Mr. Charles Collins, this intention was confirmed and carried
out. He made arrangements for the sale of Tavistock House
to Mr. Davis, a Jewish gentleman, and he gave up possession
of it in September. Up to this time Gad's Hill had been
furnished merely as a temporary summer residence&mdash;pictures,
library, and all best furniture being left in the London
house. He now set about beautifying and making Gad's
Hill thoroughly comfortable and homelike. And there was
not a year afterwards, up to the year of his death, that he
did not make some addition or improvement to it. He also
furnished, as a private residence, a sitting-room and some
bedrooms at his office in Wellington Street, to be used, when
there was no house in London, as occasional town quarters
by himself, his daughter, and sister-in-law.</div>

<p>He began in this summer his occasional papers for "All
the Year Round," which he called "The Uncommercial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Traveller," and which were continued at intervals in his
journal until 1869.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year he began another story, to be
published weekly in "All the Year Round." The letter to
Mr. Forster, which we give, tells him of this beginning
and gives him the name of the book. The first number
of "Great Expectations" appeared on the 1st December.
The Christmas number, this time, was written jointly by
himself and Mr. Wilkie Collins. The scene was laid at
Clovelly, and they made a journey together into Devonshire
and Cornwall, for the purpose of this story, in
November.</p>

<p>The letter to Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton is, unfortunately,
the only one we have as yet been able to procure. The
present Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India, has kindly endeavoured
to help us even during his absence from England.
But it was found to be impossible without his own assistance
to make the necessary search among his father's
papers. And he has promised us that, on his return, he
will find and lend to us, many letters from Charles Dickens,
which are certainly in existence, to his distinguished fellow-writer
and great friend. We hope, therefore, it may be
possible for us at some future time to be able to publish
these letters, as well as those addressed to the present
Lord Lytton (when he was Mr. Robert Lytton, otherwise
"Owen Meredith," and frequent contributor to "Household
Words" and "All the Year Round"). We have the same
hope with regard to letters addressed to Sir Henry Layard,
at present Ambassador at Constantinople, which, of course,
for the same reason, cannot be lent to us at the present time.</p>

<p>We give a letter to Mr. Forster on one of his books
on the Commonwealth, the "Impeachment of the Five
Members;" which, as with other letters which we are glad
to publish on the subject of Mr. Forster's own works, was
not used by himself for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>A letter to his daughter Mamie (who, after her sister's
marriage, paid a visit with her dear friends the White family
to Scotland, where she had a serious illness) introduces a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
recent addition to the family, who became an important
member of it, and one to whom Charles Dickens was very
tenderly attached&mdash;her little white Pomeranian dog "Mrs.
Bouncer" (so called after the celebrated lady of that name
in "Box and Cox"). It is quite necessary to make this
formal introduction of the little pet animal (who lived to
be a very old dog and died in 1874), because future letters
to his daughter contain constant references and messages
to "Mrs. Bouncer," which would be quite unintelligible
without this explanation. "Boy," also referred to in this
letter, was his daughter's horse. The little dog and the
horse were gifts to Mamie Dickens from her friends Mr.
and Mrs. Arthur Smith, and the sister of the latter, Miss
Craufurd.</p>

<p>A happy New Year to you, and many happy years!
I cannot tell you how delighted I was to receive your
Christmas letter, or with what pleasure I have received
Forster's emphatic accounts of your health and spirits.
But when was I ever wrong? And when did I not tell
you that you were an impostor in pretending to grow
older as the rest of us do, and that you had a secret of your
own for reversing the usual process! It happened that I
read at Cheltenham a couple of months ago, and that I have
rarely seen a place that so attracted my fancy. I had
never seen it before. Also I believe the character of its
people to have greatly changed for the better. All sorts of
long-visaged prophets had told me that they were dull,
stolid, slow, and I don't know what more that is disagreeable.
I found them exactly the reverse in all respects; and
I saw an amount of beauty there&mdash;well&mdash;that is not to be
more specifically mentioned to you young fellows.</p>

<p>Katie dined with us yesterday, looking wonderfully well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

whereof I seem to remember having seen sparks afore now.

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wilkie</span>,</div>

<p>I have read this book with great care and attention.
There cannot be a doubt that it is a very great advance on
all your former writing, and most especially in respect of
tenderness. In character it is excellent. Mr. Fairlie as
good as the lawyer, and the lawyer as good as he. Mr.
Vesey and Miss Halcombe, in their different ways, equally
meritorious. Sir Percival, also, is most skilfully shown,
though I doubt (you see what small points I come to) whether
any man ever showed uneasiness by hand or foot without
being forced by nature to show it in his face too. The story
is very interesting, and the writing of it admirable.</p>

<p>I seem to have noticed, here and there, that the great
pains you take express themselves a trifle too much, and
you know that I always contest your disposition to give an
audience credit for nothing, which necessarily involves the
forcing of points on their attention, and which I have always
observed them to resent when they find it out&mdash;as they
always will and do. But on turning to the book again, I
find it difficult to take out an instance of this. It rather
belongs to your habit of thought and manner of going about
the work. Perhaps I express my meaning best when I say
that the three people who write the narratives in these
proofs have a <span class="smcap">dissective</span> property in common, which is
essentially not theirs but yours; and that my own effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would be to strike more of what is got <i>that way</i> out of them
by collision with one another, and by the working of the
story.</p>

<p>You know what an interest I have felt in your powers
from the beginning of our friendship, and how very high I
rate them? <i>I</i> know that this is an admirable book, and
that it grips the difficulties of the weekly portion and
throws them in masterly style. No one else could do it
half so well. I have stopped in every chapter to notice
some instance of ingenuity, or some happy turn of writing;
and I am absolutely certain that you never did half so well
yourself.</p>

<p>So go on and prosper, and let me see some more, when
you have enough (for your own satisfaction) to show me. I
think of coming in to back you up if I can get an idea for
my series of gossiping papers. One of those days, please
God, we may do a story together; I have very odd half-formed
notions, in a mist, of something that might be done
that way.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Forster</span>,</div>

<p>It did not occur to me in reading your most excellent,
interesting, and remarkable book, that it could with any
reason be called one-sided. If Clarendon had never written
his "History of the Rebellion," then I can understand that
it might be. But just as it would be impossible to answer
an advocate who had misstated the merits of a case for his
own purpose, without, in the interests of truth, and not of the
other side merely, re-stating the merits and showing them
in their real form, so I cannot see the practicability of telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
what you had to tell without in some sort championing the
misrepresented side, and I think that you don't do that as
an advocate, but as a judge.</p>

<p>The evidence has been suppressed and coloured, and the
judge goes through it and puts it straight. It is not <i>his</i>
fault if it all goes one way and tends to one plain conclusion.
Nor is it his fault that it goes the further when it is laid out
straight, or seems to do so, because it was so knotted and
twisted up before.</p>

<p>I can understand any man's, and particularly Carlyle's,
having a lingering respect that does not like to be disturbed
for those (in the best sense of the word) loyal gentlemen of
the country who went with the king and were so true to him.
But I don't think Carlyle sufficiently considers that the great
mass of those gentlemen <i>didn't know the truth</i>, that it was a
part of their loyalty to believe what they were told on the
king's behalf, and that it is reasonable to suppose that the
king was too artful to make known to <i>them</i> (especially after
failure) what were very acceptable designs to the desperate
soldiers of fortune about Whitehall. And it was to me a
curious point of adventitious interest arising out of your
book, to reflect on the probability of their having been as
ignorant of the real scheme in Charles's head, as their
descendants and followers down to this time, and to think
with pity and admiration that they believed the cause to be
so much better than it was. This is a notion I was anxious
to have expressed in our account of the book in these
pages. For I don't suppose Clarendon, or any other such
man to sit down and tell posterity something that he has
not "tried on" in his own time. Do you?</p>

<p>In the whole narrative I saw nothing anywhere to which
I demurred. I admired it all, went with it all, and was
proud of my friend's having written it all. I felt it to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
all square and sound and right, and to be of enormous
importance in these times. Firstly, to the people who (like
myself) are so sick of the shortcomings of representative
government as to have no interest in it. Secondly, to the
humbugs at Westminster who have come down&mdash;a long,
long way&mdash;from those men, as you know. When the great
remonstrance came out, I was in the thick of my story, and
was always busy with it; but I am very glad I didn't read
it then, as I shall read it now to much better purpose. All
the time I was at work on the "Two Cities," I read no
books but such as had the air of the time in them.</p>

<p>To return for a final word to the Five Members. I
thought the marginal references overdone. Here and
there, they had a comical look to me for that reason, and
reminded me of shows and plays where everything is in
the bill.</p>

<p>Lastly, I should have written to you&mdash;as I had a strong
inclination to do, and ought to have done, immediately after
reading the book&mdash;but for a weak reason; of all things in
the world I have lost heart in one&mdash;I hope no other&mdash;I
cannot, times out of calculation, make up my mind to write
a letter.</p>

<p>You asked me on Christmas Eve about my children.
My second daughter is going to be married in the course
of the summer to Charles Collins, the brother of Wilkie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Collins, the novelist. The father was one of the most
famous painters of English green lanes and coast pieces.
He was bred an artist; is a writer, too, and does "The Eye
Witness," in "All the Year Round." He is a gentleman,
accomplished, and amiable. My eldest daughter has not
yet started any conveyance on the road to matrimony (that
I know of); but it is likely enough that she will, as she is
very agreeable and intelligent. They are both very pretty.
My eldest boy, Charley, has been in Barings' house for
three or four years, and is now going to Hong Kong,
strongly backed up by Barings, to buy tea on his own
account, as a means of forming a connection and seeing
more of the practical part of a merchant's calling, before
starting in London for himself. His brother Frank
(Jeffrey's godson) I have just recalled from France and
Germany, to come and learn business, and qualify himself
to join his brother on his return from the Celestial Empire.
The next boy, Sydney Smith, is designed for the navy, and
is in training at Portsmouth, awaiting his nomination. He
is about three foot high, with the biggest eyes ever seen,
and is known in the Portsmouth parts as "Young Dickens,
who can do everything."</p>

<p>Another boy is at school in France; the youngest of all
has a private tutor at home. I have forgotten the second
in order, who is in India. He went out as ensign of a
non-existent native regiment, got attached to the 42nd
Highlanders, one of the finest regiments in the Queen's
service; has remained with them ever since, and got made
a lieutenant by the chances of the rebellious campaign,
before he was eighteen. Miss Hogarth, always Miss
Hogarth, is the guide, philosopher, and friend of all the
party, and a very close affection exists between her and the
girls. I doubt if she will ever marry. I don't know
whether to be glad of it or sorry for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>I have laid down my pen and taken a long breath after
writing this family history. I have also considered whether
there are any more children, and I don't think there are.
If I should remember two or three others presently, I will
mention them in a postscript.</p>

<p>We think Townshend looking a little the worse for the
winter, and we perceive Bully to be decidedly old upon his
legs, and of a most diabolical turn of mind. When they
first arrived the weather was very dark and cold, and kept
them indoors. It has since turned very warm and bright,
but with a dusty and sharp east wind. They are still kept
indoors by this change, and I begin to wonder what change
will let them out. Townshend dines with us every Sunday.
You may be sure that we always talk of you and yours, and
drink to you heartily.</p>

<p>Public matters here are thought to be rather improving;
the deep mistrust of the gentleman in Paris being
counteracted by the vigorous state of preparation into
which the nation is getting. You will have observed,
of course, that we establish a new defaulter in respect
of some great trust, about once a quarter. The last
one, the cashier of a City bank, is considered to have
distinguished himself greatly, a quarter of a million of
money being high game.</p>

<p>No, my friend, I have not shouldered my rifle yet, but I
should do so on more pressing occasion. Every other man
in the row of men I know&mdash;if they were all put in a row&mdash;is
a volunteer though. There is a tendency rather to
overdo the wearing of the uniform, but that is natural
enough in the case of the youngest men. The turn-out is
generally very creditable indeed. At the ball they had (in
a perfectly unventilated building), their new leather belts
and pouches smelt so fearfully that it was, as my eldest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
daughter said, like shoemaking in a great prison. She,
consequently, distinguished herself by fainting away in the
most inaccessible place in the whole structure, and being
brought out (horizontally) by a file of volunteers, like some
slain daughter of Albion whom they were carrying into the
street to rouse the indignant valour of the populace.</p>

<p>Lord, my dear Cerjat, when I turn to that page of your
letter where you write like an ancient sage in whom the
fire has paled into a meek-eyed state of coolness and virtue,
I half laugh and half cry! <i>You</i> old! <i>You</i> a sort of hermit?
Boh! Get out.</p>

<p>With this comes my love and all our loves, to you and
Mrs. Cerjat, and your daughter. I add my special and
particular to the sweet "singing cousin." When shall you
and I meet, and where? Must I come to see Townshend?
I begin to think so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Edward
Bulwer
Lytton.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Gad's Hill</span>, <i>Tuesday, June 5th, 1860.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I am very much interested and gratified by your
letter concerning "A Tale of Two Cities." I do not quite
agree with you on two points, but that is no deduction from
my pleasure.</p>

<p>In the first place, although the surrender of the feudal
privileges (on a motion seconded by a nobleman of great
rank) was the occasion of a sentimental scene, I see no
reason to doubt, but on the contrary, many reasons to believe,
that some of these privileges had been used to the frightful
oppression of the peasant, quite as near to the time of the
Revolution as the doctor's narrative, which, you will remember,
dates long before the Terror. And surely when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the new philosophy was the talk of the salons and the slang
of the hour, it is not unreasonable or unallowable to suppose
a nobleman wedded to the old cruel ideas, and representing
the time going out, as his nephew represents the time coming
in; as to the condition of the peasant in France generally at
that day, I take it that if anything be certain on earth it is
certain that it was intolerable. No <i>ex post facto</i> enquiries
and provings by figures will hold water, surely, against the
tremendous testimony of men living at the time.</p>

<p>There is a curious book printed at Amsterdam, written
to make out no case whatever, and tiresome enough in its
literal dictionary-like minuteness, scattered up and down
the pages of which is full authority for my marquis. This
is "Mercier's Tableau de Paris." Rousseau is the authority
for the peasant's shutting up his house when he had a bit of
meat. The tax-taker was the authority for the wretched
creature's impoverishment.</p>

<p>I am not clear, and I never have been clear, respecting
that canon of fiction which forbids the interposition of
accident in such a case as Madame Defarge's death.
Where the accident is inseparable from the passion and
emotion of the character, where it is strictly consistent with
the whole design, and arises out of some culminating proceeding
on the part of the character which the whole story
has led up to, it seems to me to become, as it were, an act
of divine justice. And when I use Miss Pross (though this
is quite another question) to bring about that catastrophe, I
have the positive intention of making that half-comic intervention
a part of the desperate woman's failure, and of
opposing that mean death&mdash;instead of a desperate one in the
streets, which she wouldn't have minded&mdash;to the dignity of
Carton's wrong or right; this <i>was</i> the design, and seemed
to be in the fitness of things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as to the reading. I am sorry to say that it is out
of the question this season. I have had an attack of
rheumatism&mdash;quite a stranger to me&mdash;which remains hovering
about my left side, after having doubled me up in the
back, and which would disable me from standing for two
hours. I have given up all dinners and town engagements,
and come to my little Falstaff House here, sensible of the
necessity of country training all through the summer.
Smith would have proposed any appointment to see you on
the subject, but he has been dreadfully ill with tic. Whenever
I read in London, I will gladly put a night aside for
your purpose, and we will plot to connect your name with
it, and give it some speciality. But this could not be before
Christmas time, as I should not be able to read sooner, for
in the hot weather it would be useless. Let me hear from
you about this when you have considered it. It would
greatly diminish the expenses, remember.</p>

I heartily thank you for it, and highly esteem it. I understand
that the article on the spirits to which you refer was
written by &mdash;&mdash; (he played an Irish porter in one scene of
Bulwer's comedy at Devonshire House). Between ourselves,
I think it must be taken with a few grains of salt,

<p>Your description of your sea-castle makes your room
here look uncommonly dusty. Likewise the costermongers
in the street outside, and the one customer (drunk, with his
head on the table) in the Crown Coffee House over the way,
in York Street, have an earthy, and, as I may say, a land-lubberly
aspect. Cape Horn, to the best of <i>my</i> belief, is a
tremendous way off, and there are more bricks and cabbage-leaves
between this office and that dismal point of land than
<i>you</i> can possibly imagine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming here from the station this morning, I met,
coming from the execution of the Wentworth murderer,
such a tide of ruffians as never could have flowed from any
point but the gallows. Without any figure of speech it
turned one white and sick to behold them.</p>

<p>Tavistock House is cleared to-day, and possession delivered
up. I must say that in all things the purchaser has
behaved thoroughly well, and that I cannot call to mind
any occasion when I have had money dealings with a
Christian that have been so satisfactory, considerate, and
trusting.</p>

<p>I am ornamented at present with one of my most
intensely preposterous and utterly indescribable colds. If
you were to make a voyage from Cape Horn to Wellington
Street, you would scarcely recognise in the bowed form,
weeping eyes, rasped nose, and snivelling wretch whom you
would encounter here, the once gay and sparkling, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Everything else here is as quiet as possible. Business
reports you receive from Holsworth. Wilkie looked in
to-day, going to Gloucestershire for a week. The office is
full of discarded curtains and coverings from Tavistock
House, which Georgina is coming up this evening to select
from and banish. Mary is in raptures with the beauties of
Dunkeld, but is not very well in health. The Admiral
(Sydney) goes up for his examination to-morrow. If he
fails to pass with credit, I will never believe in anybody
again, so in that case look out for your own reputation
with me.</p>

<p>This is really all the news I have, except that I am lazy,
and that Wilkie dines here next Tuesday, in order that we
may have a talk about the Christmas number.</p>

<p>I beg to send my kind regard to Mrs. Wills, and to
enquire how she likes wearing a hat, which of course she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
does. I also want to know from her in confidence whether

<p>Yesterday I burnt, in the field at Gad's Hill, the accumulated

a smoke like the genie when he got out of the casket on the

rained very heavily when I finished, I suspect my correspondence
of having overcast the face of the heavens.</p>

<p>Hullah's daughter (an artist) tells me that certain female
students have addressed the Royal Academy, entreating
them to find a place for their education. I think it a
capital move, for which I can do something popular and
telling in <i>The Register</i>. Adelaide Procter is active in the
business, and has a copy of their letter. Will you write to
her for that, and anything else she may have about it,
telling her that I strongly approve, and want to help them
myself?</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Watson</span>,</div>

<p>I lose no time in answering your letter; and first as
to business, the school in the High Town at Boulogne was
excellent. The boys all English, the two proprietors an old
Eton master and one of the Protestant clergymen of the
town. The teaching unusually sound and good. The
manner and conduct developed in the boys quite admirable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
But I have never seen a gentleman so perfectly acquainted
with boy-nature as the Eton master. There was a perfect
understanding between him and his charges; nothing
pedantic on his part, nothing slavish on their parts. The
result was, that either with him or away from him, the boys
combined an ease and frankness with a modesty and sense
of responsibility that was really above all praise. Alfred
went from there to a great school at Wimbledon, where they
train for India and the artillery and engineers. Sydney
went from there to Mr. Barrow, at Southsea. In both
instances the new masters wrote to me of their own accord,
bearing quite unsolicited testimony to the merits of the old,
and expressing their high recognition of what they had
done. These things speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Sydney has just passed his examination as a naval cadet
and come home, all eyes and gold buttons. He has twelve
days' leave before going on board the training-ship. Katie
and her husband are in France, and seem likely to remain
there for an indefinite period. Mary is on a month's visit
in Scotland; Georgina, Frank, and Plorn are at home here;
and we all want Mary and her little dog back again. I
have sold Tavistock House, am making this rather complete
in its way, and am on the restless eve of beginning a new
big book; but mean to have a furnished house in town
(in some accessible quarter) from February or so to June.
May we meet there.</p>

<p>Your handwriting is always so full of pleasant memories
to me, that when I took it out of the post-office at Rochester
this afternoon it quite stirred my heart. But we must not
think of old times as sad times, or regard them as anything
but the fathers and mothers of the present. We must all
climb steadily up the mountain after the talking bird, the
singing tree, and the yellow water, and must all bear in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mind that the previous climbers who were scared into
looking back got turned into black stone.</p>

<p>Mary Boyle was here a little while ago, as affectionate at
heart as ever, as young, and as pleasant. Of course we
talked often of you. So let me know when you are established
in Halfmoon Street, and I shall be truly delighted
to come and see you.</p>

<p>For my attachments are strong attachments and never
weaken. In right of bygones, I feel as if "all Northamptonshire"
belonged to me, as all Northumberland did to Lord
Bateman in the ballad. In memory of your warming your
feet at the fire in that waste of a waiting-room when I read
at Brighton, I have ever since taken that watering-place to
my bosom as I never did before. And you and Switzerland
are always one to me, and always inseparable.</p>

<p>Charley was heard of yesterday, from Shanghai, going
to Japan, intending to meet his brother Walter at Calcutta,
and having an idea of beguiling the time between whiles by
asking to be taken as an amateur with the English Chinese
forces. Everybody caressed him and asked him everywhere,
and he seemed to go. With kind regards, my dear

<p>I did not write to you in your bereavement, because
I knew that the girls had written to you, and because I
instinctively shrunk from making a form of what was so
real. <i>You</i> knew what a loving and faithful remembrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
I always had of your mother as a part of my youth&mdash;no
more capable of restoration than my youth itself. All the
womanly goodness, grace, and beauty of my drama went
out with her. To the last I never could hear her voice
without emotion. I think of her as of a beautiful part of
my own youth, and this dream that we are all dreaming
seems to darken.</p>

<p>But it is not to say this that I write now. It comes to
the point of my pen in spite of me.</p>

<p>"Holding up the Mirror" is in next week's number. I
have taken out all this funeral part of it. Not because I
disliked it (for, indeed, I thought it the best part of the

proof at that time, as a remembrance that would be better
reserved a little while. Also because it made rather a
mixture of yourself as an individual, with something that
does not belong or attach to you as an individual. You
can have the MS.; and as a part of a paper describing your

no change or adaption.</p>

<p>If you had been away from us and ill with anybody
in the world but our dear Mrs. White, I should have been
in a state of the greatest anxiety and uneasiness about you.
But as I know it to be impossible that you could be in
kinder or better hands, I was not in the least restless about
you, otherwise than as it grieved me to hear of my poor
dear girl's suffering such pain. I hope it is over now for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
many a long day, and that you will come back to us a
thousand times better in health than you left us.</p>

<p>Don't come back too soon. Take time and get well
restored. There is no hurry, the house is not near to-rights
yet, and though we all want you, and though Boy wants
you, we all (including Boy) deprecate a fatiguing journey
being taken too soon.</p>

<p>As to the carpenters, they are absolutely maddening.
They are always at work, yet never seem to do anything.
Lillie was down on Friday, and said (his eye fixed on
Maidstone, and rubbing his hand to conciliate his moody
employer) that "he didn't think there would be very much
left to do after Saturday, the 29th."</p>

<p>I didn't throw him out of the window. Your aunt tells
you all the news, and leaves me no chance of distinguishing
myself, I know. You have been told all about my brackets
in the drawing-room, all about the glass rescued from the
famous stage-wreck of Tavistock House, all about everything
here and at the office. The office is really a success.
As comfortable, cheerful, and private as anything of the
kind can possibly be.</p>

<p>I took the Admiral (but this you know too, no doubt)
to Dollond's, the mathematical instrument maker's, last
Monday, to buy that part of his outfit. His sextant (which
is about the size and shape of a cocked hat), on being applied
to his eye, entirely concealed him. Not the faintest vestige
of the distinguished officer behind it was perceptible to the
human vision. All through the City, people turned round
and stared at him with the sort of pleasure people take in a
little model. We went on to Chatham this day week, in
search of some big man-of-war's-man who should be under
obligation to salute him&mdash;unfortunately found none. But
this no doubt you know too, and all my news falls flat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>I am driven out of my room by paint, and am writing in
the best spare room. The whole prospect is excessively wet;
it does not rain now, but yesterday it did tremendously, and
it rained very heavily in the night. We are even muddy;
and that is saying a great deal in this dry country of chalk
and sand. Everywhere the corn is lying out and saturated
with wet. The hops (nearly everywhere) look as if they had
been burnt.</p>

<p>In my mind's eye I behold Mrs. Bouncer, still with
some traces of her late anxiety on her faithful countenance,
balancing herself a little unequally on her bow fore-legs,
pricking up her ears, with her head on one side, and slightly
opening her intellectual nostrils. I send my loving and
respectful duty to her.</p>

<p>At the Waterloo station we were saluted with
"Hallo! here's Dickens!" from divers naval cadets, and
Sir Richard Bromley introduced himself to me, who had his
cadet son with him, a friend of Sydney's. We went down
together, and the boys were in the closest alliance. Bromley
being Accountant-General of the Navy, and having influence
on board, got their hammocks changed so that they would
be serving side by side, at which they were greatly pleased.
The moment we stepped on board, the "Hul-lo! here's
Dickens!" was repeated on all sides, and the Admiral
(evidently highly popular) shook hands with about fifty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his messmates. Taking Bromley for my model (with whom
I fraternised in the most pathetic manner), I gave Sydney a
sovereign before stepping over the side. He was as little
overcome as it was possible for a boy to be, and stood
waving the gold-banded cap as we came ashore in a boat.</p>

<p>There is no denying that he looks very small aboard a
great ship, and that a boy must have a strong and decided
speciality for the sea to take to such a life. Captain Harris
was not on board, but the other chief officers were, and were
highly obliging. We went over the ship. I should say
that there can be little or no individuality of address to any
particular boy, but that they all tumble through their education
in a crowded way. The Admiral's servant (I mean our
Admiral's) had an idiotic appearance, but perhaps it did him
injustice (a mahogany-faced marine by station). The Admiral's
washing apparatus is about the size of a muffin-plate, and he
could easily live in his chest. The meeting with Bromley
was a piece of great good fortune, and the dear old chap
could not have been left more happily.</p>

<p>It would be a great pleasure to me to come to you,
an immense pleasure, and to sniff the sea I love (from the
shore); but I fear I must come down one morning and come
back at night. I will tell you why.</p>

<p>Last week, I got to work on a new story. I called a
council of war at the office on Tuesday. It was perfectly
clear that the one thing to be done was, for me to strike
in. I have therefore decided to begin a story, the length
of the "Tale of Two Cities," on the 1st of December&mdash;begin
publishing, that is. I must make the most I can out
of the book. When I come down, I will bring you the
first two or three weekly parts. The name is, "<span class="smcap">Great

<p>Now the preparations to get ahead, combined with the

tightly. It will be just as much as I can hope to do. Therefore,
what I had hoped would be a few days at Eastbourne

<p>I took the Admiral down to Portsmouth. Every maritime
person in the town knew him. He seemed to know
every boy on board the <i>Britannia</i>, and was a tremendous
favourite evidently. It was very characteristic of him that
they good-naturedly helped him, he being so very small,
into his hammock at night. But he couldn't rest in it on
these terms, and got out again to learn the right way of
getting in independently. Official report stated that "after
a few spills, he succeeded perfectly, and went to sleep."
He is perfectly happy on board, takes tea with the captain,
leads choruses on Saturday nights, and has an immense
marine for a servant.</p>

<p>I saw Edmund Yates at the office, and he told me that
during all his mother's wanderings of mind, which were
almost incessant at last, she never once went back to the
old Adelphi days until she was just dying, when he heard
her say, in great perplexity: "I can <i>not</i> get the words."</p>

<p>Best love to Mrs. Forster.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wilkie</span>,</div>

<p>I have been down to Brighton to see Forster, and
found your letter there on arriving by express this morning.
I also found a letter from Georgina, describing that Mary's
horse went down suddenly on a stone, and how Mary was
thrown, and had her riding-habit torn to pieces, and has a
deep cut just above the knee&mdash;fortunately not in the knee
itself, which is doing exceedingly well, but which will
probably incapacitate her from walking for days and days
to come. It is well it was no worse. The accident occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
at Milton, near Gravesend, and they found Mary in a
public-house there, wonderfully taken care of and looked
after.</p>

<p>I propose that we start on Thursday morning, the
1st of November. The train for Penzance leaves the Great
Western terminus at a quarter-past nine in the morning.
It is a twelve hours' journey. Shall we meet at the
terminus at nine? I shall be here all the previous day,
and shall dine here.</p>

<p>Your account of your passage goes to my heart through
my stomach. What a pity I was not there on board to
present that green-visaged, but sweet-tempered and uncomplaining
spectacle of imbecility, at which I am so
expert under stormy circumstances, in the poet's phrase:</p>

<div class='poem'>
As I sweep<br />
Through the deep,<br />
When the stormy winds do blow.<br />
</div>

<p>What a pity I am not there, at Meurice's, to sleep the
sleep of infancy through the long plays where the gentlemen
stand with their backs to the mantelpieces. What a
pity I am not with you to make a third at the Trois Fr&egrave;res,
and drink no end of bottles of Bordeaux, without ever
getting a touch of redness in my (poet's phrase again)
"innocent nose." But I must go down to Gad's to-night,
and get to work again. Four weekly numbers have been
ground off the wheel, and at least another must be turned
before we meet. They shall be yours in the slumberous
railway-carriage.</p>

<p>I don't think Forster is at all in good health. He was
tremendously hospitable and hearty. I walked six hours
and a half on the downs yesterday, and never stopped or
sat. Early in the morning, before breakfast, I went to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
nearest baths to get a shower-bath. They kept me waiting
longer than I thought reasonable, and seeing a man in a
cap in the passage, I went to him and said: "I really must
request that you'll be good enough to see about this shower-bath;"
and it was Hullah! waiting for another bath.</p>

<p>Rumours were brought into the house on Saturday
night, that there was a "ghost" up at Larkins's monument.
Plorn was frightened to death, and I was apprehensive of
the ghost's spreading and coming there, and causing
"warning" and desertion among the servants. Frank was
at home, and Andrew Gordon was with us. Time, nine
o'clock. Village talk and credulity, amazing. I armed the
two boys with a short stick apiece, and shouldered my
double-barrelled gun, well loaded with shot. "Now
observe," says I to the domestics, "if anybody is playing
tricks and has got a head, I'll blow it off." Immense
impression. New groom evidently convinced that he has
entered the service of a bloodthirsty demon. We ascend
to the monument. Stop at the gate. Moon is rising.
Heavy shadows. "Now, look out!" (from the bloodthirsty
demon, in a loud, distinct voice). "If the ghost is
here and I see him, so help me God I'll fire at him!"
Suddenly, as we enter the field, a most extraordinary noise
responds&mdash;terrific noise&mdash;human noise&mdash;and yet superhuman
noise. B. T. D. brings piece to shoulder. "Did
you hear that, pa?" says Frank. "I did," says I. Noise
repeated&mdash;portentous, derisive, dull, dismal, damnable. We
advance towards the sound. Something white comes
lumbering through the darkness. An asthmatic sheep!
Dead, as I judge, by this time. Leaving Frank to guard
him, I took Andrew with me, and went all round the
monument, and down into the ditch, and examined the field
well, thinking it likely that somebody might be taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
advantage of the sheep to frighten the village. Drama
ends with discovery of no one, and triumphant return to
rum-and-water.</p>

<p>I write (with the most impracticable iron pen on
earth) to report our safe arrival here, in a beastly hotel.
We start to-morrow morning at nine on a two days' posting
between this and Liskeard in Cornwall. We are due in
Liskeard (but nobody seems to know anything about the
roads) on Saturday afternoon, and we purpose making an
excursion in that neighbourhood on Sunday, and coming
up from Liskeard on Monday by Great Western fast train,
which will get us to London, please God, in good time on
Monday evening. There I shall hear from you, and know
whether dear Mamie will move to London too.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant journey down here, and a beautiful
day. No adventures whatever. Nothing has happened to
Wilkie, and he sends love.</p>

<p>We had stinking fish for dinner, and have been able to
drink nothing, though we have ordered wine, beer, and
brandy-and-water. There is nothing in the house but two
tarts and a pair of snuffers. The landlady is playing cribbage
with the landlord in the next room (behind a thin

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mary</span>,</div>

<p>I cannot tell you how much I thank you for the beautiful
cigar-case, and how seasonable, and friendly, and good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and warm-hearted it looked when I opened it at Gad's Hill.
Besides which, it is a cigar-case, and will hold cigars; two
crowning merits that I never yet knew to be possessed by
any article claiming the same name. For all of these
reasons, but more than all because it comes from you, I love
it, and send you eighteen hundred and sixty kisses, with one
in for the new year.</p>

<p>Both excellent stories and perfectly new. Your Joe
swears that he never heard either&mdash;never a word or
syllable of either&mdash;after he laughed at 'em this blessed
day.</p>

<p>I have no news, except that I am not quite well, and am
being doctored. Pray read "Great Expectations." I think
it is very droll. It is a very great success, and seems
universally liked. I suppose because it opens funnily, and
with an interest too.</p>

<p>I pass my time here (I am staying here alone) in working,
taking physic, and taking a stall at a theatre every
night. On Boxing Night I was at Covent Garden. A dull
pantomime was "worked" (as we say) better than I ever saw
a heavy piece worked on a first night, until suddenly and
without a moment's warning, every scene on that immense
stage fell over on its face, and disclosed chaos by gaslight
behind! There never was such a business; about sixty people
who were on the stage being extinguished in the most remarkable
manner. Not a soul was hurt. In the uproar, some
moon-calf rescued a porter pot, six feet high (out of which
the clown had been drinking when the accident happened),
and stood it on the cushion of the lowest proscenium box,
P.S., beside a lady and gentleman, who were dreadfully
ashamed of it. The moment the house knew that nobody
was injured, they directed their whole attention to this
gigantic porter pot in its genteel position (the lady and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gentleman trying to hide behind it), and roared with
laughter. When a modest footman came from behind the
curtain to clear it, and took it up in his arms like a Brobdingnagian
baby, we all laughed more than ever we had
laughed in our lives. I don't know why.</p>

<p>We have had a fire here, but our people put it out
before the parish-engine arrived, like a drivelling perambulator,
with <i>the beadle in it</i>, like an imbecile baby.
Popular opinion, disappointed in the fire having been put
out, snowballed the beadle. God bless it!</p>

<p>Over the way at the Lyceum, there is a very fair Christmas
piece, with one or two uncommonly well-done nigger
songs&mdash;one remarkably gay and mad, done in the finale to
a scene. Also a very nice transformation, though I don't
know what it means.</p>

<p>The poor actors waylay me in Bow Street, to represent
their necessities; and I often see one cut down a court
when he beholds me coming, cut round Drury Lane to
face me, and come up towards me near this door in the
freshest and most accidental way, as if I was the last
person he expected to see on the surface of this globe. The
other day, there thus appeared before me (simultaneously
with a scent of rum in the air) one aged and greasy man,
with a pair of pumps under his arm. He said he thought if
he could get down to somewhere (I think it was Newcastle),
he would get "taken on" as Pantaloon, the existing Pantaloon
being "a stick, sir&mdash;a mere muff." I observed that I
was sorry times were so bad with him. "Mr. Dickens, you
know our profession, sir&mdash;no one knows it better, sir&mdash;there
is no right feeling in it. I was Harlequin on your own
circuit, sir, for five-and-thirty years, and was displaced by
a boy, sir!&mdash;a boy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>So no more at present, except love to Mrs. Watson and
Bedgey Prig and all, from my dear Mary.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;DON'T I pine neither?</p>

but he had got into a Christmas habit of mind, and wouldn't
respond.</p>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>

<h2>1861.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>This</span>, as far as his movements were concerned, was again
a very unsettled year with Charles Dickens. He hired a
furnished house in the Regent's Park, which he, with his
household, occupied for some months. During the season
he gave several readings at St. James's Hall. After a short
summer holiday at Gad's Hill, he started, in the autumn, on
a reading tour in the English provinces. Mr. Arthur Smith,
being seriously ill, could not accompany him in this tour;
and Mr. Headland, who was formerly in office at the
St. Martin's Hall, was engaged as business-manager of
these readings. Mr. Arthur Smith died in October, and
Charles Dickens's distress at the loss of this loved friend
and companion is touchingly expressed in many of his letters
of this year.</div>

<p>There are also sorrowful allusions to the death of his
brother-in-law, Mr. Henry Austin, which sad event likewise
happened in October. And the letter we give to Mrs. Austin
("Letitia") has reference to her sad affliction.</p>

<p>In June of this year he paid a short visit to Sir E. B.
Lytton at Knebworth, accompanied by his daughter and
sister-in-law, who also during his autumn tour joined him in
Edinburgh. But this course of readings was brought rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
suddenly to an end on account of the death of the Prince
Consort.</p>

<p>Besides being constantly occupied with the business of
these readings, Charles Dickens was still at work on his
story of "Great Expectations," which was appearing
weekly in "All the Year Round." The story closed on
the 3rd of August, when it was published as a whole in
three volumes, and inscribed to Mr. Chauncey Hare Townshend.
The Christmas number of "All the Year Round"
was called "Tom Tiddler's Ground," to which Charles
Dickens contributed three stories.</p>

<p>Our second letter in this year is given more as a specimen
of the claims which were constantly being made upon Charles
Dickens's time and patience, than because we consider the
letter itself to contain much public interest; excepting,
indeed, as showing his always considerate and courteous
replies to such constant applications.</p>

<p>"The fire" mentioned in the letter to Mr. Forster was
the great fire in Tooley Street. The "Morgan" was an
American sea-captain, well known in those days, and greatly
liked and respected. It may interest our readers to know
that the character of Captain Jorgan, in the Christmas
number of the previous year, was suggested by this pleasant
sailor, for whom Charles Dickens had a hearty liking.
Young Mr. Morgan was, during the years he passed in
England, a constant visitor at Gad's Hill. The "Elwin"
mentioned in the letter written from Bury St. Edmunds,
was the Rev. Whitwell Elwin, a Norfolk gentleman, well
known in the literary world, and who was for many years
editor of "The Quarterly Review."</p>

<p>The explanation of the letter to Mr. John Agate, of
Dover, we give in that gentleman's own words:</p>

<p>"There are few public men with the strain upon their
time and energies which he had particularly (and which I
know better now that I have read his life), who would have
spared the time to have written such a long courteous letter.</p>

<p>"I wrote to him rather in anger, and left the letter
myself at The Lord Warden, as I and my family were very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
much disappointed, after having purchased our tickets so
long before, to find we could not got into the room, as money
was being received, but his kind letter explained all."</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>I feel it quite hopeless to endeavour to present
my position before you, in reference to such a letter as
yours, in its plain and true light. When you suppose it
would have cost Mr. Thackeray "but a word" to use his
influence to obtain you some curatorship or the like, you fill
me with the sense of impossibility of leading you to a more
charitable judgment of Mr. Dickens.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I will put the truth before you. Scarcely
a day of my life passes, or has passed for many years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
without bringing me some letters similar to yours. Often
they will come by dozens&mdash;scores&mdash;hundreds. My time and
attention would be pretty well occupied without them, and
the claims upon me (some very near home), for all the
influence and means of help that I do and do not possess,
are not commonly heavy. I have no power to aid you
towards the attainment of your object. It is the simple
exact truth, and nothing can alter it. So great is the disquietude
I constantly undergo from having to write to some
new correspondent in this strain, that, God knows, I would
resort to another relief if I could.</p>

<p>Your studies from nature appear to me to express an
excellent observation of nature, in a loving and healthy
spirit. But what then? The dealers and dealers' prices of
which you complain will not be influenced by that honest
opinion. Nor will it have the least effect upon the President
of the Royal Academy, or the Directors of the School of
Design. Assuming your supposition to be correct that
these authorities are adverse to you, I have no more
power than you have to render them favourable. And
assuming them to be quite disinterested and dispassionate
towards you, I have no voice or weight in any appointment
that any of them make.</p>

<p>I will retain your packet over to-morrow, and will then
cause it to be sent to your house. I write under the
pressure of occupation and business, and therefore write
briefly.</p>

Faithfully yours.<br />

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>You have read in the papers of our heavy English
frost. At Gad's Hill it was so intensely cold, that in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
warm dining-room on Christmas Day we could hardly sit at
the table. In my study on that morning, long after a great
fire of coal and wood had been lighted, the thermometer
was I don't know where below freezing. The bath froze,
and all the pipes froze, and remained in a stony state for
five or six weeks. The water in the bedroom-jugs froze,
and blew up the crockery. The snow on the top of the
house froze, and was imperfectly removed with axes. My
beard froze as I walked about, and I couldn't detach my
cravat and coat from it until I was thawed at the fire. My
boys and half the officers stationed at Chatham skated
away without a check to Gravesend&mdash;five miles off&mdash;and
repeated the performance for three or four weeks. At last
the thaw came, and then everything split, blew up, dripped,
poured, perspired, and got spoilt. Since then we have had
a small visitation of the plague of servants; the cook (in a
riding-habit) and the groom (in a dress-coat and jewels)
having mounted Mary's horse and mine, in our absence,
and scoured the neighbouring country at a rattling pace.
And when I went home last Saturday, I innocently wondered
how the horses came to be out of condition, and gravely
consulted the said groom on the subject, who gave it as his
opinion "which they wanted reg'lar work." We are now
coming to town until midsummer. Having sold my own
house, to be more free and independent, I have taken a very
pretty furnished house, No. 3, Hanover Terrace, Regent's
Park. This, of course, on my daughter's account. For I
have very good and cheerful bachelor rooms here, with an
old servant in charge, who is the cleverest man of his kind
in the world, and can do anything, from excellent carpentery
to excellent cookery, and has been with me three-and-twenty
years.</p>

<p>The American business is the greatest English sensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
at present. I venture to predict that the struggle of violence
will be a very short one, and will be soon succeeded by some
new compact between the Northern and Southern States.
Meantime the Lancashire mill-owners are getting very
uneasy.</p>

<p>The Italian state of things is not regarded as looking
very cheerful. What from one's natural sympathies with a
people so oppressed as the Italians, and one's natural antagonism
to a pope and a Bourbon (both of which superstitions
I do suppose the world to have had more than enough of), I
agree with you concerning Victor Emmanuel, and greatly
fear that the Southern Italians are much degraded. Still,
an united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of
the world, and would be a rock in Louis Napoleon's way, as
he very well knows. Therefore the idea must be championed,
however much against hope.</p>

<p>My eldest boy, just home from China, was descried by
Townshend's Henri the moment he landed at Marseilles,
and was by him borne in triumph to Townshend's rooms.
The weather was snowy, slushy, beastly; and Marseilles
was, as it usually is to my thinking, well-nigh intolerable.
My boy could not stay with Townshend, as he was coming on
by express train; but he says: "I sat with him and saw
him dine. He had a leg of lamb, and a tremendous cold."
That is the whole description I have been able to extract
from him.</p>

<p>This journal is doing gloriously, and "Great Expectations"
is a great success. I have taken my third boy, Frank
(Jeffrey's godson), into this office. If I am not mistaken,
he has a natural literary taste and capacity, and may do
very well with a chance so congenial to his mind, and being
also entered at the Bar.</p>

<p>Dear me, when I have to show you about London, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
we dine <i>en gar&ccedil;on</i> at odd places, I shall scarcely know
where to begin. Only yesterday I walked out from here in
the afternoon, and thought I would go down by the Houses
of Parliament. When I got there, the day was so beautifully
bright and warm, that I thought I would walk on by
Millbank, to see the river. I walked straight on <i>for three
miles</i> on a splendid broad esplanade overhanging the
Thames, with immense factories, railway works, and what-not
erected on it, and with the strangest beginnings and
ends of wealthy streets pushing themselves into the very
Thames. When I was a rower on that river, it was all
broken ground and ditch, with here and there a public-house
or two, an old mill, and a tall chimney. I had never
seen it in any state of transition, though I suppose myself to
know this rather large city as well as anyone in it.</p>

<p>There is little doubt, I think, of my reading at
Cheltenham somewhere about November. I submit myself
so entirely to Arthur Smith's arrangements for me, that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
express my sentiments on this head with modesty. But I
think there is scarcely a doubt of my seeing you then.</p>

<p>I have just finished my book of "Great Expectations,"
and am the worse for wear. Neuralgic pains in the face
have troubled me a good deal, and the work has been
pretty close. But I hope that the book is a good book, and
I have no doubt of very soon throwing off the little damage
it has done me.</p>

<p>What with Blondin at the Crystal Palace and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Leotard'">L&eacute;otard</ins>
at Leicester Square, we seem to be going back to barbaric
excitements. I have not seen, and don't intend to see, the
Hero of Niagara (as the posters call him), but I have been
beguiled into seeing <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Leotard'">L&eacute;otard</ins>, and it is at once the most
fearful and most graceful thing I have ever seen done.</p>

<p>Clara White (grown pretty) has been staying with us.</p>

<p>I am sore afraid that <i>The Times</i>, by playing fast and
loose with the American question, has very seriously compromised
this country. The Americans northward are
perfectly furious on the subject; and Motley the historian
(a very sensible man, strongly English in his sympathies)
assured me the other day that he thought the harm done
very serious indeed, and the dangerous nature of the daily
widening breach scarcely calculable.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the
end of "Great Expectations" from and after Pip's return to
Joe's, and finding his little likeness there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Bulwer (who has been, as I think I told you, extraordinarily
taken by the book), so strongly urged it upon me,
after reading the proofs, and supported his views with such
good reasons, that I resolved to make the change. You
shall have it when you come back to town. I have put in a
very pretty piece of writing, and I have no doubt the story
will be more acceptable through the alteration.</p>

<p>I have not seen Bulwer's changed story. I brought back
the first month with me, and I know the nature of his changes
throughout; but I have not yet had the revised proofs. He
was in a better state at Knebworth than I have ever seen
him in all these years, a little weird occasionally regarding
magic and spirits, but perfectly fair and frank under opposition.
He was talkative, anecdotical, and droll; looked
young and well, laughed heartily, and enjoyed some games
we played with great zest. In his artist character and talk
he was full of interest and matter, but that he always is.
Socially, he seemed to me almost a new man. I thoroughly
enjoyed myself, and so did Georgina and Mary.</p>

<p>The fire I did not see until the Monday morning, but it
was blazing fiercely then, and was blazing hardly less
furiously when I came down here again last Friday. I was
here on the night of its breaking out. If I had been in
London I should have been on the scene, pretty surely.</p>

<p>You will be perhaps surprised to hear that it is Morgan's
conviction (his son was here yesterday), that the North will
put down the South, and that speedily. In his management
of his large business, he is proceeding steadily on that
conviction. He says that the South has no money and no
credit, and that it is impossible for it to make a successful
stand. He may be all wrong, but he is certainly a very
shrewd man, and he has never been, as to the United States,
an enthusiast of any class.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Lord Campbell's seems to me as easy and good a
death as one could desire. There must be a sweep of these
men very soon, and one feels as if it must fall out like the
breaking of an arch&mdash;one stone goes from a prominent
place, and then the rest begin to drop. So one looks
towards Brougham, and Lyndhurst, and Pollock.</p>

<p>I will add no more to this, or I know I shall not send it;
for I am in the first desperate laziness of having done my
book, and think of offering myself to the village school as a
live example of that vice for the edification of youth.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Watson</span>,</div>

<p>I have owed you a letter for so long a time that I fear
you may sometimes have misconstrued my silence. But I
hope that the sight of the handwriting of your old friend
will undeceive you, if you have, and will put that right.</p>

<p>During the progress of my last story, I have been working
so hard that very, very little correspondence&mdash;except enforced
correspondence on business&mdash;has passed this pen. And now
that I am free again, I devote a few of my first leisure
moments to this note.</p>

<p>You seemed in your last to think that I had forgotten
you in respect of the Christmas number. Not so at all. I
discussed with them here where you were, how you were to
be addressed, and the like; finally left the number in a
blank envelope, and did not add the address to it until it
would have been absurd to send you such stale bread. This
was my fault, but this was all. And I should be so pained
at heart if you supposed me capable of failing in my truth
and cordiality, or in the warm remembrance of the time we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
have passed together, that perhaps I make more of it than
you meant to do.</p>

<p>My sailor-boy is at home&mdash;I was going to write, for the
holidays, but I suppose I must substitute "on leave."
Under the new regulations, he must not pass out of the
<i>Britannia</i> before December. The younger boys are all at
school, and coming home this week for the holidays. Mary
keeps house, of course, and Katie and her husband surprised
us yesterday, and are here now. Charley is holiday-making
at Guernsey and Jersey. He has been for some time seeking
a partnership in business, and has not yet found one. The
matter is in the hands of Mr. Bates, the managing partner
in Barings' house, and seems as slow a matter to adjust
itself as ever I looked on at. Georgina is, as usual, the
general friend and confidante and factotum of the whole
party.</p>

<p>Your present correspondent read at St. James's Hall
in the beginning of the season, to perfectly astounding
audiences; but finding that fatigue and excitement very difficult
to manage in conjunction with a story, deemed it prudent
to leave off reading in high tide and mid-career, the rather
by reason of something like neuralgia in the face. At the
end of October I begin again; and if you are at Brighton
in November, I shall try to see you there. I deliver myself
up to Mr. Arthur Smith, and I know it is one of the places
for which he has put me down.</p>

<p>This is all about me and mine, and next I want to know
why you never come to Gad's Hill, and whether you are
never coming. The stress I lay on these questions you will
infer from the size of the following note of interrogation
<img src="images/questionmark.png" width="10" height="17" alt="Handwritten: ?" title="Handwritten: ?" /></p>


<p>I am in the constant receipt of news from Lausanne.
Of Mary Boyle, I daresay you have seen and heard more
than I have lately. Rumours occasionally reach me of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
acting in every English shire incessantly, and getting in a
harvest of laurels all the year round. Cavendish I have not
seen for a long time, but when I did see him last, it was at
Tavistock House, and we dined together jovially. Mention
of that locality reminds me that when you <span class="smcap">do</span> come here,
you will see the pictures looking wonderfully better, and
more precious than they ever did in town. Brought together
in country light and air, they really are quite a baby
collection and very pretty.</p>

<p>I direct this to Rockingham, supposing you to be there
in this summer time. If you are as leafy in Northamptonshire
as we are in Kent, you are greener than you have been
for some years. I hope you may have seen a large-headed
photograph with little legs, representing the undersigned,
pen in hand, tapping his forehead to knock an idea out. It
has just sprung up so abundantly in all the shops, that I
am ashamed to go about town looking in at the picture-windows,
which is my delight. It seems to me extraordinarily
ludicrous, and much more like than the grave
portrait done in earnest. It made me laugh when I first
came upon it, until I shook again, in open sunlighted
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Pray be a good Christian to me, and don't be retributive
in measuring out the time that shall pass before you write
to me. And believe me ever,</p>

<p>I have been going to write to you ever since I
received your letter from Whitby, and now I hear from
Charley that you are coming home, and must be addressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in the Rue Harley. Let me know whether you will dine
here this day week at the usual five. I am at present so
addle-headed (having hard Wednesday work in Wills's
absence) that I can't write much.</p>

<p>I have got the "Copperfield" reading ready for delivery,
and am now going to blaze away at "Nickleby,"
which I don't like half as well. Every morning I "go in"
at these marks for two or three hours, and then collapse
and do nothing whatever (counting as nothing much cricket
and rounders).</p>

<p>In my time that curious railroad by the Whitby Moor
was so much the more curious, that you were balanced
against a counter-weight of water, and that you did it like
Blondin. But in these remote days the one inn of Whitby
was up a back-yard, and oyster-shell grottoes were the only
view from the best private room. Likewise, sir, I have
posted to Whitby. "Pity the sorrows of a poor old man."</p>

<p>The sun is glaring in at these windows with an amount
of ferocity insupportable by one of the landed interest, who
lies upon his back with an imbecile hold on grass, from
lunch to dinner. Feebleness of mind and head are the result.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The boys have multiplied themselves by fifty

<p>If you go away, don't you think in the main you would
be better here than anywhere? You know how well you
would be nursed, what care we should take of you, and how
perfectly quiet and at home you would be, until you become
strong enough to take to the Medway. Moreover, I think
you would be less anxious about the tour, here, than away
from such association. I would come to Worthing to fetch
you, I needn't say, and would take the most careful charge
of you. I will write no more about this, because I wish to
avoid giving you more to read than can be helped; but I
do sincerely believe it would be at once your wisest and
least anxious course. As to a long journey into Wales, or
any long journey, it would never do. Nice is not to be
thought of. Its dust, and its sharp winds (I know it well),
towards October are very bad indeed.</p>

<p>I send you the enclosed letters, firstly, because I have
no circular to answer them with, and, secondly, because I
fear I might confuse your arrangements by interfering with
the correspondence. I shall hope to have a word from you

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Watkins</span>,</div>

<p>In reply to your kind letter I must explain that I
have not yet brought down any of your large photographs
of myself, and therefore cannot report upon their effect
here. I think the "cartes" are all liked.</p>

<p>A general howl of horror greeted the appearance of
No. 18, and a riotous attempt was made to throw it out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of window. I calmed the popular fury by promising that
it should never again be beheld within these walls. I think
I mentioned to you when you showed it to me, that I felt
persuaded it would not be liked. It has a grim and wasted
aspect, and perhaps might be made useful as a portrait of
the Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p>I feel that I owe you an apology for being (innocently)
a difficult subject. When I once excused myself to Ary
Scheffer while sitting to him, he received the apology as
strictly his due, and said with a vexed air: "At this moment,
<i>mon cher</i> Dickens, you look more like an energetic Dutch
admiral than anything else;" for which I apologised again.</p>

<p>In the hope that the pains you have bestowed upon me
will not be thrown away, but that your success will prove
of some use to you, believe me,</p>

<p>I was so very much distressed last night in thinking of
it all, and I find it so very difficult to preserve my composure
when I dwell in my mind on the many times fast
approaching when I shall sorely miss the familiar face, that
I am hardly steady enough yet to refer to the readings like
a man. But your kind reference to them makes me desirous
to tell you that I took Headland (formerly of St. Martin's
Hall, who has always been with us in London) to conduct
the business, when I knew that our poor dear fellow could
never do it, even if he had recovered strength to go; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that I consulted with himself about it when I saw him for
the last time on earth, and that it seemed to please him,
and he said: "We couldn't do better."</p>

to town Wednesday mornings.</p>

<p>This is a short note. But the moment I know for
certain what is designed for me at Cheltenham, I write to
you in order that you may know it from me and not by
chance from anyone else.</p>

<p>I am to read there on the evening of Friday, the 3rd of
January, and on the morning of Saturday, the 4th; as I
have nothing to do on Thursday, the 2nd, but come from
Leamington, I shall come to you, please God, for a quiet
dinner that day.</p>

<p>The death of Arthur Smith has caused me great distress
and anxiety. I had a great regard for him, and he made
the reading part of my life as light and pleasant as it <i>could</i>
be made. I had hoped to bring him to see you, and had
pictured to myself how amused and interested you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have been with his wonderful tact and consummate mastery
of arrangement. But it's all over.</p>

<p>I begin at Norwich on the 28th, and am going north in the
middle of November. I am going to do "Copperfield," and
shall be curious to test its effect on the Edinburgh people.
It has been quite a job so to piece portions of the long book
together as to make something continuous out of it; but I
hope I have got something varied and dramatic. I am also
(not to slight <i>your</i> book) going to do "Nickleby at Mr.
Squeers's." It is clear that both must be trotted out at
Cheltenham.</p>

<p>With kindest love and regard to all your house,</p>

<p>I have just now received your welcome letter, and I
hasten to report (having very little time) that we had a
splendid hall last night, and that I think "Nickleby" tops
all the readings. Somehow it seems to have got in it, by
accident, exactly the qualities best suited to the purpose,
and it went last night not only with roars, but with a
general hilarity and pleasure that I have never seen
surpassed.</p>

<p>We are full here for to-night.</p>

<p>Fancy this: last night at about six, who should walk in
but Elwin! He was exactly in his usual state, only more
demonstrative than ever, and had been driven in by some
neighbours who were coming to the reading. I had tea up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for him, and he went down at seven with me to the dismal
den where I dressed, and sat by the fire while I dressed, and
was childishly happy in that great privilege! During the
reading he sat on a corner of the platform and roared incessantly.
He brought in a lady and gentleman to introduce
while I was undressing, and went away in a perfect and
absolute rapture.</p>

<p>I cannot say that we began well last night. We had
not a good hall, and they were a very lumpish audience
indeed. This did not tend to cheer the strangeness I felt
in being without Arthur, and I was not at all myself. We
have a large let for to-night, I think two hundred and fifty
stalls, which is very large, and I hope that both they and I
will go better. I could have done perfectly last night, if
the audience had been bright, but they were an intent and
staring audience. They laughed though very well, and the
storm made them shake themselves again. But they were
not magnetic, and the great big place was out of sorts
somehow.</p>

<p>To-morrow I will write you another short note, however
short. It is "Nickleby" and the "Trial" to-night;
"Copperfield" again to-morrow. A wet day here, with
glimpses of blue. I shall not forget Katey's health at
dinner. A pleasant journey down.</p>

St. Edmunds. But I think (and hope) I did. We had a
fine room there, and "Copperfield" made a great impression.
At mid-day we go on to Colchester, where I shall expect
the young Morgans. I sent a telegram on yesterday, after
receiving your note, to secure places for them. The answer
returned by telegraph was: "No box-seats left but on the
fourth row." If they prefer to sit on the stage (for I read
in the theatre, there being no other large public room),
they shall. Meantime I have told John, who went forward
this morning with the other men, to let the people at the
inn know that if three travellers answering that description
appear before my dinner-time, they are to dine
with me.</p>

<p>Plorn's admission that he likes the school very much
indeed, is the great social triumph of modern times.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to Sunday's rest at Gad's, and
shall be down by the ten o'clock train from town. I miss
poor Arthur dreadfully. It is scarcely possible to imagine
how much. It is not only that his loss to me socially is quite
irreparable, but that the sense I used to have of compactness
and comfort about me while I was reading is quite
gone. And when I come out for the ten minutes, when
I used to find him always ready for me with something
cheerful to say, it is forlorn. I cannot but fancy, too, that
the audience must miss the old speciality of a pervading
gentleman.</p>

<p>Nobody I know has turned up yet except Elwin. I
have had many invitations to all sorts of houses in all sorts
of places, and have of course accepted them every one.</p>

<p>Love to Mamie, if she has come home, and to Bouncer,

<p>I am exceedingly sorry to find, from the letter you
have addressed to me, that you had just cause of complaint
in being excluded from my reading here last night. It
will now and then unfortunately happen when the place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
reading is small (as in this case), that some confusion and
inconvenience arise from the local agents over-estimating, in
perfect good faith and sincerity, the capacity of the room.
Such a mistake, I am assured, was made last night; and
thus all the available space was filled before the people in
charge were at all prepared for that circumstance.</p>

<p>You may readily suppose that I can have no personal
knowledge of the proceedings of the people in my employment
at such a time. But I wish to assure you very
earnestly, that they are all old servants, well acquainted
with my principles and wishes, and that they are under the
strongest injunction to avoid any approach to mercenary
dealing; and to behave to all comers equally with as much
consideration and politeness as they know I should myself
display. The recent death of a much-regretted friend of
mine, who managed this business for me, and on whom
these men were accustomed to rely in any little difficulty,
caused them (I have no doubt) to feel rather at a loss in
your case. Do me the favour to understand that under any
other circumstances you would, as a matter of course, have
been provided with any places whatever that could be
found, without the smallest reference to what you had
originally paid. This is scanty satisfaction to you, but it is
so strictly the truth, that yours is the first complaint of the
kind I have ever received.</p>

<p>I hope to read in Dover again, but it is quite impossible
that I can make any present arrangement for that purpose.
Whenever I may return here, you may be sure I shall not
fail to remember that I owe you a recompense for a disappointment.
In the meanwhile I very sincerely regret it.</p>

left untaken at each place.</p>

<p>The storm was most magnificent at Dover. All the
great side of The Lord Warden next the sea had to be
emptied, the break of the sea was so prodigious, and the
noise was so utterly confounding. The sea came in like
a great sky of immense clouds, for ever breaking suddenly
into furious rain. All kinds of wreck were washed in.
Miss Birmingham and I saw, among other things, a very
pretty brass-bound chest being thrown about like a feather.
On Tuesday night, the unhappy Ostend packet could not
get in, neither could she go back, and she beat about the
Channel until noon yesterday. I saw her come in then,
<i>with five men at the wheel;</i> such a picture of misery, as to
the crew (of passengers there were no signs), as you can
scarcely imagine.</p>

<p>The effect at Hastings and at Dover really seems to have
outdone the best usual impression, and at Dover they
wouldn't go, but sat applauding like mad. The most delicate
audience I have seen in any provincial place is Canterbury.
The audience with the greatest sense of humour
certainly is Dover. The people in the stalls set the example
of laughing, in the most curiously unreserved way; and
they really laughed when Squeers read the boys' letters,
with such cordial enjoyment, that the contagion extended
to me, for one couldn't hear them without laughing too.</p>

<p>So, thank God, all goes well, and the recompense for the
trouble is in every way great. There is rather an alarming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
breakdown at Newcastle, in respect of all the bills having
been, in some inscrutable way, lost on the road. I have
resolved to send Berry there, with full powers to do all
manner of things, early next week.</p>

<p>The amended route-list is not printed yet, because I
am trying to get off Manchester and Liverpool; both of
which I strongly doubt, in the present state of American
affairs. Therefore I can't send it for Marguerite; but I
can, and do, send her my love and God-speed. This is
addressed to the office because I suppose you will be there
to-morrow.</p>

<span class="smcap">Queen's Head, Newcastle</span>, <i>Friday, Nov. 22nd, 1861.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I received your letter this morning, and grieve to report
that the unlucky Headland has broken down most awfully!</p>

<p>First, as perhaps you remember, this is the place where
the bills were "lost" for a week or two. The consequence
has been that the agent could not announce all through the
"Jenny Lind" time (the most important for announcing),
and could but stand still and stare when people came to ask
what I was going to read. Last night I read "Copperfield"
to the most enthusiastic and appreciative audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
imaginable, but in numbers about half what they might have
been. To-night we shall have a famous house; but we
might have had it last night too. To-morrow (knowing by
this time what can, of a certainty, be done with "Copperfield"),
I had, of course, given out "Copperfield" to be
read again. Conceive my amazement and dismay when I
find the printer to have announced "Little Dombey"!!!
This, I declare, I had no more intention of reading than I
had of reading an account of the solar system. And this,
after a sensation last night, of a really extraordinary nature
in its intensity and delight!</p>

<p>Says the unlucky Headland to this first head of misery:
"Johnson's mistake" (Johnson being the printer).</p>

<p>Second, I read at Edinburgh for the first time&mdash;observe
the day&mdash;<i>next Wednesday</i>. Jenny Lind's concert at Edinburgh
is to-night. This morning comes a frantic letter
from the Edinburgh agent. "I have no bills, no tickets;
I lose all the announcement I would have made to hundreds
upon hundreds of people to-night, all of the most desirable
class to be well informed beforehand. I can't announce
what Mr. Dickens is going to read; I can answer no question;
I have, upon my responsibility, put a dreary advertisement
into the papers announcing that he <i>is</i> going to
read so many times, and that particulars will shortly be
ready; and I stand bound hand and foot." "Johnson's
mistake," says the unlucky Headland.</p>

<p>Of course, I know that the man who never made a mistake
in poor Arthur's time is not likely to be always making
mistakes now. But I have written by this post to Wills, to
go to him and investigate. I have also detached Berry
from here, and have sent him on by train at a few minutes'
notice to Edinburgh, and then to Glasgow (where I have no
doubt everything is wrong too). Glasgow we may save;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Edinburgh I hold to be irretrievably damaged. If it can
be picked up at all, it can only be at the loss of the two
first nights, and by the expenditure of no end of spirits
and force. And this is the harder, because it is impossible
not to see that the last readings polished and prepared the
audiences in general, and that I have not to work them
up in any place where I have been before, but that they
start with a London intelligence, and with a respect and
preparation for what they are going to hear.</p>

<p>I hope by the time you and Mamie come to me, we shall
have got into some good method. I must take the thing
more into my own hands and look after it from hour to
hour. If such a thing as this Edinburgh business could
have happened under poor Arthur, I really believe he
would have fallen into a fit, or gone distracted. No one
can ever know what he was but I who have been with him
and without him. Headland is so anxious and so good-tempered
that I cannot be very stormy with him; but it
is the simple fact that he has no notion of the requirements
of such work as this. Without him, and with a
larger salary to Berry (though there are objections to the
latter as <i>first</i> man), I could have done a hundred times
better.</p>

<p>As Forster will have a strong interest in knowing all
about the proceedings, perhaps you will send him this letter
to read. There is no very tremendous harm, indeed, done
as yet. At Edinburgh I <span class="smcap">know</span> what I can do with
"Copperfield." I think it is not too much to say that for
every one who does come to hear it on the first night, I can
get back fifty on the second. And whatever can be worked
up there will tell on Glasgow. Berry I shall continue to
send on ahead, and I shall take nothing on trust and more
as being done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday morning at six, I have to start for Berwick.
From Berwick, in the course of that day, I will write again;
to Mamie next time.</p>

<p>With best love to her and Mrs. B.</p>

<i>Saturday, Nov. 23rd, 1861.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A most tremendous hall here last night; something
almost terrible in the cram. A fearful thing might have
happened. Suddenly, when they were all very still over
Smike, my gas batten came down, and it looked as if the
room was falling. There were three great galleries crammed
to the roof, and a high steep flight of stairs, and a panic
must have destroyed numbers of people. A lady in the
front row of stalls screamed, and ran out wildly towards
me, and for one instant there was a terrible wave in the
crowd. I addressed that lady laughing (for I knew she
was in sight of everybody there), and called out as if it
happened every night, "There's nothing the matter, I assure
you; don't be alarmed; pray sit down;" and she sat down
directly, and there was a thunder of applause. It took
some few minutes to mend, and I looked on with my hands
in my pockets; for I think if I had turned my back for a
moment there might still have been a move. My people
were dreadfully alarmed, Boylett in particular, who I
suppose had some notion that the whole place might have
taken fire.</p>

<p>"But there stood the master," he did me the honour to
say afterwards, in addressing the rest, "as cool as ever I
see him a-lounging at a railway station."</p>

<p>A telegram from Berry at Edinburgh yesterday evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to say that he had got the bills, and that they would all be
up and dispersed yesterday evening under his own eyes.
So no time was lost in setting things as right as they can
be set. He has now gone on to Glasgow.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Duty to Mrs. Bouncer.</p>

<span class="smcap">Berwick-on-Tweed</span>, <i>Monday, Nov. 25th, 1861.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I write (in a gale of wind, with a high sea running), to
let you know that we go on to Edinburgh at half-past
eight to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>A most ridiculous room was designed for me in this odd
out-of-the-way place. An immense Corn Exchange made
of glass and iron, round, dome-topped, lofty, utterly absurd
for any such purpose, and full of thundering echoes, with a
little lofty crow's-nest of a stone gallery breast high, deep
in the wall, into which it was designed to put <i>me!</i> I instantly
struck, of course, and said I would either read in a
room attached to this house (a very snug one, capable of
holding five hundred people) or not at all. Terrified local
agents glowered, but fell prostrate.</p>

<p>Berry has this moment come back from Edinburgh and
Glasgow with hopeful accounts. He seems to have done
the business extremely well, and he says that it was quite
curious and cheering to see how the Glasgow people
assembled round the bills the instant they were posted, and
evidently with a great interest in them.</p>

<p>We left Newcastle yesterday morning in the dark, when
it was intensely cold and froze very hard. So it did here.
But towards night the wind went round to the S.W., and
all night it has been blowing very hard indeed. So it is
now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell Mamie that I have the same sitting-room as we
had when we came here with poor Arthur, and that my
bedroom is the room out of it which she and Katie had.
Surely it is the oddest town to read in! But it is taken on
poor Arthur's principle that a place in the way pays the
expenses of a through journey; and the people would seem
to be coming up to the scratch gallantly. It was a dull
Sunday, though; O it <i>was</i> a dull Sunday, without a book!
For I had forgotten to buy one at Newcastle, until it was
too late. So after dark I made a jug of whisky-punch,
and drowned the unlucky Headland's remembrance of his
failures.</p>

<p>I shall hope to hear very soon that the workmen have
"broken through," and that you have been in the state
apartments, and that upholstery measurements have come
off.</p>

<p>There has been a horrible accident in Edinburgh. One
of the seven-storey old houses in the High Street fell when
it was full of people. Berry was at the bill-poster's house,
a few doors off, waiting for him to come home, when he
heard what seemed like thunder, and then the air was
darkened with dust, "as if an immense quantity of steam
had been blown off," and then all that dismal quarter set
up shrieks, which he says were most dreadful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bouncer must decidedly come with you to Carlisle.

let me know <i>when</i> you purpose coming there. We shall be
there, please God, on the Saturday in good time, as I finish
at Glasgow on the Friday night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>I have very little notion of the state of affairs here, as
Headland brought no more decisive information from the
agents yesterday (he never <i>can</i> get decisive information
from any agents), than "the teeckets air joost moving
reecht and left." I hope this may be taken as satisfactory.
Jenny Lind carried off a world of money from here. Miss
Glyn, or Mrs. Dallas, is playing Lady Macbeth at the theatre,
and Mr. Shirley Brooks is giving two lectures at the Philosophical
Society on the House of Commons and Horace
Walpole. Grisi's farewell benefits are (I think) on my last
two nights here.</p>

<p>Gordon dined with me yesterday. He is, if anything,
rather better, I think, than when we last saw him in town.
He was immensely pleased to be with me. I went with him
(as his office goes anywhere) right into and among the ruins
of the fallen building yesterday. They were still at work
trying to find two men (brothers), a young girl, and an old
woman, known to be all lying there. On the walls two or
three common clocks are still hanging; one of them, judging
from the time at which it stopped, would seem to have gone
for an hour or so after the fall. Great interest had been
taken in a poor linnet in a cage, hanging in the wind and
rain high up against the broken wall. A fireman got it
down alive, and great exultation had been raised over it.
One woman, who was dug out unhurt, staggered into the
street, stared all round her, instantly ran away, and has
never been heard of since. It is a most extraordinary sight,
and of course makes a great sensation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>I think it is my turn to write to you, and I therefore
send a brief despatch, like a telegram, to let you know that
in a gale of wind and a fierce rain, last night, we turned
away a thousand people. There was no getting into the
hall, no getting near the hall, no stirring among the people,
no getting out, no possibility of getting rid of them. And
yet, in spite of all that, and of their being steaming wet,
they never flagged for an instant, never made a complaint,
and took up the trial upon their very shoulders, to the last
word, in a triumphant roar.</p>

<p>The talk about "Copperfield" rings through the whole
place. It is done again to-morrow night. To-morrow
morning I read "Dombey." To-morrow morning is Grisi's
"farewell" morning concert, and last night was her "farewell"
evening concert. Neither she, nor Jenny Lind, nor
anything, nor anybody seems to make the least effect on
the draw of the readings.</p>

<p>I lunch with Blackwood to-day. He was at the reading
last night; a capital audience. Young Blackwood has also
called here. A very good young fellow, I think.</p>

</div>

<p>I send you by this post another <i>Scotsman</i>. From a
paragraph in it, a letter, and an advertisement, you may be
able to form some dim guess of the scene at Edinburgh last
night. Such a pouring of hundreds into a place already
full to the throat, such indescribable confusion, such a
rending and tearing of dresses, and yet such a scene of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
good humour on the whole. I never saw the faintest
approach to it. While I addressed the crowd in the room,
Gordon addressed the crowd in the street. Fifty frantic
men got up in all parts of the hall and addressed me all at
once. Other frantic men made speeches to the walls. The
whole Blackwood family were borne in on the top of a wave,
and landed with their faces against the front of the platform.
I read with the platform crammed with people. I got them
to lie down upon it, and it was like some impossible tableau
or gigantic picnic; one pretty girl in full dress lying on
her side all night, holding on to one of the legs of my table.
It was the most extraordinary sight. And yet from the
moment I began to the moment of my leaving off, they
never missed a point, and they ended with a burst of cheers.</p>

<p>The confusion was decidedly owing to the local agents.
But I think it may have been a little heightened by Headland's
way of sending them the tickets to sell in the first
instance.</p>

<p>Now, as I must read again in Edinburgh on Saturday
night, your travelling arrangements are affected. So observe
carefully (you and Mamie) all that I am going to say. It
appears to me that the best course will be for you to come
to <i>Edinburgh</i> on Saturday; taking the fast train from the
Great Northern station at nine in the morning. This would
bring you to the Waterloo at Edinburgh, at about nine or
so at night, and I should be home at ten. We could then
have a quiet Sunday in Edinburgh, and go over to Carlisle
on the Monday morning.</p>

<p>The expenditure of lungs and spirits was (as you may
suppose) rather great last night, and to sleep well was out
of the question; I am therefore rather fagged to-day. And
as the hall in which I read to-night is a large one, I must
make my letter a short one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>My people were torn to ribbons last night. They have
not a hat among them, and scarcely a coat.</p>

<p>Give my love to Mamie. To her question, "Will there
be war with America?" I answer, "Yes;" I fear the North
to be utterly mad, and war to be unavoidable.</p>

<p>The news of the Christmas number is indeed glorious,
and nothing can look brighter or better than the prospects
of the illustrious publication.</p>

<p>Both Carlisle and Lancaster have come out admirably,
though I doubted both, as you did. But, unlike you, I
always doubted this place. I do so still. It is a poor place
at the best (you remember?), and the mills are working half
time, and trade is very bad. The expenses, however, will
be a mere nothing. The accounts from Manchester for
to-morrow, and from Liverpool for the readings generally,
are very cheering indeed.</p>

<p>The young lady who sells the papers at the station is just
the same as ever. Has orders for to-night, and is coming
"with a person." "<i>The</i> person?" said I. "Never <i>you</i>
mind," said she.</p>

<p>I was so charmed with Robert Chambers's "Traditions
of Edinburgh" (which I read <i>in</i> Edinburgh), that I was
obliged to write to him and say so.</p>

<p>Glasgow finished nobly, and the last night in Edinburgh
was signally successful and positively splendid.</p>

<p>I have been very doubtful what to do here. We have a

so does the town clerk, so do the agents. But I have
a misgiving that they hardly understand what the public
general sympathy with the Queen will be. Further, I feel
personally that the Queen has always been very considerate
and gracious to me, and I would on no account do anything
that might seem unfeeling or disrespectful. I shall
attach great weight, in this state of indecision, to your
telegram.</p>

<p>A capital audience at Preston. Not a capacious room,
but full. Great appreciation.</p>

<p>The scene at Manchester last night was really magnificent.
I had had the platform carried forward to our
"Frozen Deep" point, and my table and screen built in
with a proscenium and room scenery. When I went in
(there was a very fine hall), they applauded in the most
tremendous manner; and the extent to which they were
taken aback and taken by storm by "Copperfield" was
really a thing to see.</p>

<p>The post closes early here on a Sunday, and I shall close
this also without further reference to "a message from

<h2>1862.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>At</span> the beginning of this year, Charles Dickens resumed the
reading tour which he had commenced at the close of the
previous year and continued up to Christmas. The first
letter which follows, to Mr. Wills, a New Year's greeting, is
written from a railway station between one town and
another on this journey. Mr. Macready, who had married
for the second time not very long before this, was now
settled at Cheltenham. Charles Dickens had arranged to
give readings there, chiefly for the pleasure of visiting him,
and of having him as one of his audience.</div>

<p>This reading tour went on until the beginning of
February. One of the last of the series was in his favourite
"beautiful room," the St. George's Hall at Liverpool. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
February, he made an exchange of houses with his friends
Mr. and Mrs. Hogge, they going to Gad's Hill, and he and
his family to Mr. Hogge's house in Hyde Park Gate South.
In March he commenced a series of readings at St. James's
Hall, which went on until the middle of June, when he,
very gladly, returned to his country home.</p>

<p>A letter beginning "My dear Girls," addressed to some
American ladies who happened to be at Colchester, in the
same inn with him when he was reading there, was
published by one of them under the name of "Our Letter,"
in the "St. Nicholas Magazine," New York, in 1877. We
think it best to explain it in the young lady's own words,
which are, therefore, appended to the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Thornbury was one of Charles Dickens's
most valuable contributors to "All the Year Round." His
letters to him about the subjects of his articles for that
journal, are specimens of the minute and careful attention
and personal supervision, never neglected or distracted by
any other work on which he might be engaged, were it ever
so hard or engrossing.</p>

<p>The letter addressed to Mr. Baylis we give chiefly
because it has, since Mr. Baylis's death, been added to the
collection of MSS. in the British Museum. He was a very
intimate and confidential friend of the late Lord Lytton,
and accompanied him on a visit to Gad's Hill in that year.</p>

<p>We give an extract from another letter from Charles
Dickens to his sister, as a beautiful specimen of a letter
of condolence and encouragement to one who was striving,
very bravely, but by very slow degrees, to recover
from the overwhelming grief of her bereavement. Mr.
Wilkie Collins was at this time engaged on his novel
of "No Name," which appeared in "All the Year
Round," and was threatened with a very serious breakdown
in health. Charles Dickens wrote the letter which
we give, to relieve Mr. Collins's mind as to his work.
Happily he recovered sufficiently to make an end to his
own story without any help; but the true friendship
and kindness which suggested the offer were none the less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
appreciated, and may, very likely, by lessening his anxiety,
have helped to restore his health. At the end of October in
this year, Charles Dickens, accompanied by his daughter and
sister-in-law, went to reside for a couple of months in Paris,

<p>Firstly, to reciprocate all your cordial and affectionate

that we may go on through many years to come, as we have

we can say that we doubt whether any two men can have
gone on more happily and smoothly, or with greater trust
and confidence in one another.</p>

<p>A little packet will come to you from Hunt and Roskell's,
almost at the same time, I think, as this note.</p>

<p>The packet will contain a claret-jug. I hope it is a
pretty thing in itself for your table, and I know that you
and Mrs. Wills will like it none the worse because it comes
from me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not made of a perishable material, and is so far
expressive of our friendship. I have had your name and
mine set upon it, in token of our many years of mutual
reliance and trustfulness. It will never be so full of wine
as it is to-day of affectionate regard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macready in voice is very like poor Mrs.
Macready dead and gone; not in the least like her otherwise.
She is perfectly satisfactory, and exceedingly winning.
Quite perfect in her manner with him and in her ease with
his children, sensible, gay, pleasant, sweet-tempered; not
in the faintest degree stiff or pedantic; accessible instantly.
I have very rarely seen a more agreeable woman. The house
is (on a smaller scale) any house we have known them in.
Furnished with the old furniture, pictures, engravings,
mirrors, tables, and chairs. Butty is too tall for strength,
I am afraid, but handsome, with a face of great power
and character, and a very nice girl. Katie you know
all about. Macready, decidedly much older and infirm.
Very much changed. His old force has gone out of
him strangely. I don't think I left off talking a minute
from the time of my entering the house to my going to
bed last night, and he was as much amused and interested
as ever I saw him; still he was, and is, unquestionably
aged.</p>

<p>And even now I am obliged to cut this letter short by
having to go and look after Headland. It would never do
to be away from the rest of them. I have no idea what we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
are doing here; no notion whether things are right or wrong;
no conception where the room is; no hold of the business
at all. For which reason I cannot rest without going and
looking after the worthy man.</p>

<p>You know, I think, that I was very averse to going to
Plymouth, and would not have gone there again but for poor
Arthur. But on the last night I read "Copperfield," and
positively enthralled the people. It was a most overpowering
effect, and poor Andrew<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> came behind the screen, after the
storm, and cried in the best and manliest manner. Also
there were two or three lines of his shipmates and other
sailors, and they were extraordinarily affected. But its
culminating effect was on Macready at Cheltenham. When
I got home after "Copperfield," I found him quite unable
to speak, and able to do nothing but square his dear old jaw
all on one side, and roll his eyes (half closed), like Jackson's
picture of him. And when I said something light about it,
he returned: "No&mdash;er&mdash;Dickens! I swear to Heaven that,
as a piece of passion and playfulness&mdash;er&mdash;indescribably mixed
up together, it does&mdash;er&mdash;no, really, Dickens!&mdash;amaze me as
profoundly as it moves me. But as a piece of art&mdash;and you
know&mdash;er&mdash;that I&mdash;no, Dickens! By &mdash;&mdash;! have seen the
best art in a great time&mdash;it is incomprehensible to me.
How is it got at&mdash;er&mdash;how is it done&mdash;er&mdash;how one man can&mdash;well?
It lays me on my&mdash;er&mdash;back, and it is of no use
talking about it!" With which he put his hand upon my
breast and pulled out his pocket-handkerchief, and I felt as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
if I were doing somebody to his Werner. Katie, by-the-bye,
is a wonderful audience, and has a great fund of wild feeling
in her. Johnny not at all unlike Plorn.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen the room here, but imagine it to be
very small. Exeter I know, and that is small also. I am
very much used up, on the whole, for I cannot bear this
moist warm climate. It would kill me very soon. And I
have now got to the point of taking so much out of
myself with "Copperfield," that I might as well do
Richard Wardour.</p>

<p>You have now, my dearest Georgy, the fullest extent of
my tidings. This is a very pretty place&mdash;a compound of
Hastings, Tunbridge Wells, and little bits of the hills about
Naples; but I met four respirators as I came up from the
station, and three pale curates without them, who seemed in
a bad way.</p>

<p>Frightful intelligence has just been brought in by
Boylett, concerning the small size of the room. I have terrified
Headland by sending him to look at it, and swearing
that if it's too small I will go away to Exeter.</p>

<p>The beautiful room was crammed to excess last night,

when it is lighted up are most brilliant to behold, and
for a reading it is simply perfect. You remember that a

<p>At Colchester, he read 'The Trial' from 'Pickwick,'

<p>The lady, her two sisters, and her brother were Mr.

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>My daughter naturally liking to be in town at this
time of year, I have changed houses with a friend for three
months.</p>

<p>My eldest boy is in business as an Eastern merchant in
the City, and will do well if he can find continuous energy;
otherwise not. My second boy is with the 42nd Highlanders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in India. My third boy, a good steady fellow, is
educating expressly for engineers or artillery. My fourth
(this sounds like a charade), a born little sailor, is a midshipman
in H.M.S. <i>Orlando</i>, now at Bermuda, and will
make his way anywhere. Remaining two at school, elder
of said remaining two very bright and clever. Georgina
and Mary keeping house for me; and Francis Jeffrey (I
ought to have counted him as the third boy, so we'll take
him in here as number two and a half) in my office at
present. Now you have the family bill of fare.</p>

<p>You ask me about Fechter and his Hamlet. It was a
performance of extraordinary merit; by far the most coherent,
consistent, and intelligible Hamlet I ever saw.
Some of the delicacies with which he rendered his conception
clear were extremely subtle; and in particular he
avoided that brutality towards Ophelia which, with a greater
or less amount of coarseness, I have seen in all other
Hamlets. As a mere <i>tour de force</i>, it would have been very
remarkable in its disclosure of a perfectly wonderful knowledge
of the force of the English language; but its merit
was far beyond and above this. Foreign accent, of course,
but not at all a disagreeable one. And he was so obviously
safe and at ease, that you were never in pain for him as a
foreigner. Add to this a perfectly picturesque and romantic
"make up," and a remorseless destruction of all conventionalities,
and you have the leading virtues of the impersonation.
In Othello he did not succeed. In Iago he is very good.
He is an admirable artist, and far beyond anyone on our
stage. A real artist and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I began reading again in London&mdash;a
condensation of "Copperfield," and "Mr. Bob Sawyer's
Party," from "Pickwick," to finish merrily. The success
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>of "Copperfield" is astounding. It made an impression
that <i>I</i> must not describe. I may only remark that
I was half dead when I had done; and that although
I had looked forward, all through the summer, when I
was carefully getting it up, to its being a London sensation;
and that although Macready, hearing it at Cheltenham,
told me to be prepared for a great effect, it even went
beyond my hopes. I read again next Thursday, and
the rush for places is quite furious. Tell Townshend this
with my love, if you see him before I have time to write
to him; and tell him that I thought the people would
never let me go away, they became so excited, and showed
it so very warmly. I am trying to plan out a new book,
but have not got beyond trying.</p>

<p>The Bow Street runners ceased out of the land soon
after the introduction of the new police. I remember them
very well as standing about the door of the office in Bow
Street. They had no other uniform than a blue dress-coat,
brass buttons (I am not even now sure that that was necessary),
and a bright red cloth waistcoat. The waistcoat was
indispensable, and the slang name for them was "redbreasts,"
in consequence.</p>

<p>They kept company with thieves and the like, much
more than the detective police do. I don't know what
their pay was, but I have no doubt their principal complements
were got under the rose. It was a very slack institution,
and its head-quarters were The Brown Bear, in Bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Street, a public-house of more than doubtful reputation,
opposite the police-office; and either the house which is
now the theatrical costume maker's, or the next door
to it.</p>

<p>Field, who advertises the Secret Enquiry Office, was a
Bow Street runner, and can tell you all about it; Goddard,
who also advertises an enquiry office, was another of the
fraternity. They are the only two I know of as yet existing
in a "questionable shape."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Baylis</span>,</div>

<p>I have been in France, and in London, and in other
parts of Kent than this, and everywhere but here, for weeks
and weeks. Pray excuse my not having (for this reason
specially) answered your kind note sooner.</p>

<p>After carefully cross-examining my daughter, I do <span class="smcap">not</span>
believe her to be worthy of the fernery. Last autumn we
transplanted into the shrubbery a quantity of evergreens
previously clustered close to the front of the house, and
trained more ivy about the wall and the like. When I ask
her where she would have the fernery and what she would
do with it, the witness falters, turns pale, becomes confused,
and says: "Perhaps it would be better not to have it at all."
I am quite confident that the constancy of the young person
is not to be trusted, and that she had better attach her
fernery to one of her ch&acirc;teaux in Spain, or one of her
English castles in the air. None the less do I thank you
for your more than kind proposal.</p>

<p>We have been in great anxiety respecting Miss Hogarth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the sudden decline of whose health and spirits has greatly
distressed us. Although she is better than she was, and the
doctors are, on the whole, cheerful, she requires great care,
and fills us with apprehension. The necessity of providing
change for her will probably take us across the water very
early in the autumn; and this again unsettles home schemes
here, and withers many kinds of fern. If they knew (by
"they" I mean my daughter and Miss Hogarth) that I was
writing to you, they would charge me with many messages
of regard. But as I am shut up in my room in a ferocious
and unapproachable condition, owing to the great accumulation
of letters I have to answer, I will tell them at lunch
that I have anticipated their wish. As I know they have
bills for me to pay, and are at present shy of producing
them, I wish to preserve a gloomy and repellent reputation.</p>

<p>I do not preach consolation because I am unwilling to
preach at any time, and know my own weakness too well.
But in this world there is no stay but the hope of a better,
and no reliance but on the mercy and goodness of God.
Through those two harbours of a shipwrecked heart, I fully
believe that you will, in time, find a peaceful resting-place
even on this careworn earth. Heaven speed the time, and
do you try hard to help it on! It is impossible to say but
that our prolonged grief for the beloved dead may grieve
them in their unknown abiding-place, and give them trouble.
The one influencing consideration in all you do as to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
disposition of yourself (coupled, of course, with a real earnest
strenuous endeavour to recover the lost tone of spirit) is,
that you think and feel you <i>can</i> do. I do not in the least
regard your change of course in going to Havre as any
evidence of instability. But I rather hope it is likely that
through such restlessness you will come to a far quieter frame
of mind. The disturbed mind and affections, like the tossed
sea, seldom calm without an intervening time of confusion
and trouble.</p>

<p>But nothing is to be attained without striving. In a
determined effort to settle the thoughts, to parcel out the
day, to find occupation regularly or to make it, to be up
and doing something, are chiefly to be found the mere
mechanical means which must come to the aid of the best
mental efforts.</p>

<p>It is a wilderness of a day, here, in the way of blowing
and raining, and as darkly dismal, at four o'clock, as need
be. My head is but just now raised from a day's writing,
but I will not lose the post without sending you a word.</p>

<p>Katie was here yesterday, just come back from Clara
White's (that was), in Scotland. In the midst of her
brilliant fortune, it is too clear to me that she is already
beckoned away to follow her dead sisters. Macready was
here from Saturday evening to yesterday morning, older
but looking wonderfully well, and (what is very rare in
these times) with the old thick sweep of hair upon his head.
Georgina being left alone here the other day, was done no
good to by a great consternation among the servants. On
going downstairs, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shefound'">she found</ins> Marsh (the stableman) seated with
great dignity and anguish in an arm-chair, and incessantly
crying out: "I am dead." To which the women servants
said with great pathos (and with some appearance of reason):
"No, you ain't, Marsh!" And to which he persisted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
replying: "Yes, I am; I am dead!" Some neighbouring
vagabond was impressed to drive a cart over to Rochester
and fetch the doctor, who said (the patient and his consolers
being all very anxious that the heart should be the scene
of affliction): "Stomach."</p>

<p>Frank Beard has been here this evening, of course
since I posted my this day's letter to you, and has told me that
you are not at all well, and how he has given you something
which he hopes and believes will bring you round. It is
not to convey this insignificant piece of intelligence, or to
tell you how anxious I am that you should come up with a
wet sheet and a flowing sail (as we say at sea when we are
not sick), that I write. It is simply to say what follows,
which I hope may save you some mental uneasiness. For I
was stricken ill when I was doing "Bleak House," and I
shall not easily forget what I suffered under the fear of not
being able to come up to time.</p>

<p>Dismiss that fear (if you have it) altogether from your
mind. Write to me at Paris at any moment, and say you
are unequal to your work, and want me, and I will come to
London straight and do your work. I am quite confident
that, with your notes and a few words of explanation, I
could take it up at any time and do it. Absurdly unnecessary
to say that it would be a makeshift! But I could do it at
a pinch, so like you as that no one should find out the difference.
Don't make much of this offer in your mind; it is
nothing, except to ease it. If you should want help, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
as safe as the bank. The trouble would be nothing to me,
and the triumph of overcoming a difficulty great. Think it
a Christmas number, an "Idle Apprentice," a "Lighthouse,"
a "Frozen Deep." I am as ready as in any of these cases to
strike in and hammer the hot iron out.</p>

<p>You won't want me. You will be well (and thankless!)
in no time. But there I am; and I hope that the knowledge
may be a comfort to you. Call me, and I come.</p>

<p>As Beard always has a sense of medical responsibility,
and says anything important about a patient in confidence,
I have merely remarked here that "Wilkie" is out of sorts.
Charley (who is here with Katie) has no other cue from me.</p>

<p>I have read "The White Rose" attentively, and
think it an extremely good play. It is vigorously written
with a great knowledge of the stage, and presents many
striking situations. I think the close particularly fine,
impressive, bold, and new.</p>

<p>But I greatly doubt the expediency of your doing <i>any</i>
historical play early in your management. By the words
"historical play," I mean a play founded on any incident
in English history. Our public are accustomed to associate
historical plays with Shakespeare. In any other hands, I
believe they care very little for crowns and dukedoms.
What you want is something with an interest of a more
domestic and general nature&mdash;an interest as romantic as
you please, but having a more general and wider response
than a disputed succession to the throne can have for
Englishmen at this time of day. Such interest culminated
in the last Stuart, and has worn itself out. It would be
uphill work to evoke an interest in Perkin Warbeck.</p>

<p>I do not doubt the play's being well received, but my
fear is that these people would be looked upon as mere
abstractions, and would have but a cold welcome in consequence,
and would not lay hold of your audience. Now,
when you <i>have</i> laid hold of your audience and have
accustomed them to your theatre, you may produce "The
White Rose," with far greater justice to the author, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the manager also. Wait. Feel your way. Perkin Warbeck
is too far removed from analogy with the sympathies and
lives of the people for a beginning.</p>

<p>Being in London two evenings in the opening week, I
tried to persuade my legs (for whose judgment I have the

induce them to pass Leicester Square. The faltering presentiment
under which they laboured so impressed me,
that at that point I yielded to their terrors. They immediately
ran away to the east, and I accompanied them to
the Olympic, where I saw a very good play, "Camilla's
Husband," very well played. Real merit in Mr. Neville
and Miss Saville.</p>

<p>We came across directly after the gale, with the Channel
all bestrewn with floating wreck, and with a hundred and
fifty sick schoolboys from Calais on board. I am going
back on the morning after Fechter's opening night, and
have promised to read "Copperfield" at the Embassy, for a

<h2>1863.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>At</span> the beginning of this year, Charles Dickens was in
Paris for the purpose of giving a reading at the English
Embassy.</div>

<p>He remained in Paris until the beginning of February,
staying with his servant "John" at the H&ocirc;tel du Helder.
There was a series of readings in London this season at
the Hanover Square Rooms. The Christmas number of
"All the Year Round" was entitled "Mrs. Lirriper's
Lodgings," to which Charles Dickens contributed the first
and last chapter.</p>

<p>The Lyceum Theatre, under the management of M.
Fechter, was opened in January with "The Duke's Motto,"
and the letter given here has reference to this first night.</p>

<p>We regret very much having no letters to Lady Molesworth,
who was an old and dear friend of Charles Dickens.
But this lady explains to us that she has long ceased to
preserve any letters addressed to her.</p>

<p>The "Mr. and Mrs. Humphery" (now Sir William and
Lady Humphery) mentioned in the first letter for this year,
were dear and intimate friends of his eldest daughter,
and were frequent guests in her father's house. Mrs.
Humphery and her sister Lady Olliffe were daughters of
the late Mr. William Cubitt, M.P.</p>

<p>We have in this year the first letter of Charles Dickens
to Mr. Percy Fitzgerald. This gentleman had been a valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
contributor to his journal before he became personally
known to Charles Dickens. The acquaintance once made
soon ripened into friendship, and for the future Mr. Fitzgerald
was a constant and always a welcome visitor to Gad's
Hill.</p>

<p>The letter to Mr. Charles Reade alludes to his story,
"Hard Cash," which was then appearing in "All the Year
Round." As a writer, and as a friend, he was held by
Charles Dickens in the highest estimation.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens's correspondence with his solicitor and
excellent friend, Mr. Frederic Ouvry (now a vice-president
of the Society of Antiquaries), was almost entirely of a
business character; but we are glad to give one or two
notes to that gentleman, although of little public interest,
in order to have the name in our book of one of the kindest
of our own friends.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Mamie</span>,</div>

<p>As I send a line to your aunt to-day and know that
you will not see it, I send another to you to report my safe
(and neuralgic) arrival here. My little rooms are perfectly
comfortable, and I like the hotel better than any I have
ever put up at in Paris. John's amazement at, and appreciation
of, Paris are indescribable. He goes about with his
mouth open, staring at everything and being tumbled over
by everybody.</p>

<p>The state dinner at the Embassy, yesterday, coming off
in the room where I am to read, the carpenters did not get
in until this morning. But their platforms were ready&mdash;or
supposed to be&mdash;and the preparations are in brisk progress.
I think it will be a handsome affair to look at&mdash;a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
handsome one. There seems to be great artistic curiosity
in Paris, to know what kind of thing the reading is.</p>

<p>I know a "rela-shon" (with one weak eye), who is in
the gunmaking line, very near here. There is a strong
family resemblance&mdash;but no muzzle. Lady Molesworth
and I have not begun to "toddle" yet, but have exchanged
affectionate greetings. I am going round to see her
presently, and I dine with her on Sunday. The only
remaining news is, that I am beset by mysterious adorers,
and smuggle myself in and out of the house in the meanest
and basest manner.</p>

<p>With kind regard to Mr. and Mrs. Humphery,</p>

<p>I was charmed by the receipt of your cordial and
sympathetic letter, and I shall always preserve it carefully
as a most noble tribute from a great and real artist.</p>

<p>I wished you had been at the Embassy on Friday evening.
The audience was a fine one, and the "Carol" is particularly
well adapted to the purpose. It is an uncommon pleasure
to me to learn that I am to meet you on Tuesday, for there
are not many men whom I meet with greater pleasure than
you. Heaven! how the years roll by! We are quite old
friends now, in counting by years. If we add sympathies,
we have been friends at least a thousand years.</p>

<p>I cannot give you any idea of the success of the
readings here, because no one can imagine the scene of last
Friday night at the Embassy. Such audiences and such
enthusiasm I have never seen, but the thing culminated on
Friday night in a two hours' storm of excitement and
pleasure. They actually recommenced and applauded right
away into their carriages and down the street.</p>

<p>You know your parent's horror of being lionised, and
will not be surprised to hear that I am half dead of it. I
cannot leave here until Thursday (though I am every hour
in danger of running away) because I have to dine out, to
say nothing of breakfasting&mdash;think of me breakfasting!&mdash;every
intervening day. But my project is to send John
home on Thursday, and then to go on a little perfectly quiet
tour for about ten days, touching the sea at Boulogne.
When I get there, I will write to your aunt (in case you
should not be at home), saying when I shall arrive at the
office. I must go to the office instead of Gad's, because I
have much to do with Forster about Elliotson.</p>

<p>I enclose a short note for each of the little boys. Give
Harry ten shillings pocket-money, and Plorn six.</p>

<p>The Olliffe girls, very nice. Florence at the readings,
prodigiously excited.</p>

<p>From my hurried note to Mamie, you will get some
faint general idea of a new star's having arisen in Paris.
But of its brightness you can have no adequate conception.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>[John has locked me up and gone out, and the little bell
at the door is ringing demoniacally while I write.]</p>

<p>You have never heard me read yet. I have been twice
goaded and lifted out of myself into a state that astonished
<i>me</i> almost as much as the audience. I have a cold, but no
neuralgia, and am "as well as can be expected."</p>

<p>I forgot to tell Mamie that I went (with Lady Molesworth)
to hear "Faust" last night. It is a splendid work,
in which that noble and sad story is most nobly and sadly
rendered, and perfectly delighted me. But I think it
requires too much of the audience to do for a London opera
house. The composer must be a very remarkable man
indeed. Some management of light throughout the story
is also very poetical and fine. We had Carvalho's box. I
could hardly bear the thing, it affected me so.</p>

<p>But, as a certain Frenchman said, "No weakness,
Danton!" So I leave off.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fechter</span>,</div>

<p>A thousand congratulations on your great success!
Never mind what they say, or do, <i>pour vous &eacute;craser;</i> you
have the game in your hands. The romantic drama,
thoroughly well done (with a touch of Shakespeare now and
then), is the speciality of your theatre. Give the public
the picturesque, romantic drama, with yourself in it; and
(as I told you in the beginning) you may throw down your
gauntlet in defiance of all comers.</p>

<p>It is a most brilliant success indeed, and it thoroughly
rejoices my heart!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot now hope to see "Maquet,"
because I am packing up and going out to dinner (it is late
in the afternoon), and I leave to-morrow morning when all
sensible people, except myself, are in bed; and I do not
come back to Paris or near it. I had hoped to see him at
breakfast last Monday, but he was not there. Paul F&eacute;val
was there, and I found him a capital fellow. If I can do
anything to help you on with "Maquet"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> when I come back
I will most gladly do it.</p>

<p>My readings here have had the finest possible reception,
and have achieved a most noble success. I never before read
to such fine audiences, so very quick of perception, and so
enthusiastically responsive.</p>

<p>I shall be heartily pleased to see you again, my dear
Fechter, and to share your triumphs with the real earnestness
of a real friend. And so go on and prosper, and believe
me, as I truly am,</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Macready</span>,</div>

<p>I have just come back from Paris, where the readings&mdash;"Copperfield,"
"Dombey" and "Trial," and "Carol"
and "Trial"&mdash;have made a sensation which modesty (my
natural modesty) renders it impossible for me to describe.
You know what a noble audience the Paris audience is!
They were at their very noblest with me.</p>

<p>I was very much concerned by hearing hurriedly from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Georgy that you were ill. But when I came home at night,
she showed me Katie's letter, and that set me up again.
Ah, you have the best of companions and nurses, and can
afford to be ill now and then for the happiness of being so
brought through it. But don't do it again yet awhile for
all that.</p>

<p>Legouv&eacute; (whom you remember in Paris as writing for the
Ristori) was anxious that I should bring you the enclosed.
A manly and generous effort, I think? Regnier desired
to be warmly remembered to you. He looks just as of yore.</p>

<p>Paris generally is about as wicked and extravagant as in
the days of the Regency. Madame Viardot in the "Orph&eacute;e,"
most splendid. An opera of "Faust," a very sad and noble
rendering of that sad and noble story. Stage management
remarkable for some admirable, and really poetical, effects
of light. In the more striking situations, Mephistopheles
surrounded by an infernal red atmosphere of his own. Marguerite
by a pale blue mournful light. The two never blending.
After Marguerite has taken the jewels placed in her
way in the garden, a weird evening draws on, and the bloom
fades from the flowers, and the leaves of the trees droop
and lose their fresh green, and mournful shadows overhang
her chamber window, which was innocently bright and gay
at first. I couldn't bear it, and gave in completely.</p>

<p>Fechter doing wonders over the way here, with a
picturesque French drama. Miss Kate Terry, in a small
part in it, perfectly charming. You may remember her
making a noise, years ago, doing a boy at an inn, in "The
Courier of Lyons"? She has a tender love-scene in this
piece, which is a really beautiful and artistic thing. I saw
her do it at about three in the morning of the day when
the theatre opened, surrounded by shavings and carpenters,
and (of course) with that inevitable hammer going; and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
told Fechter: "That is the very best piece of womanly
tenderness I have ever seen on the stage, and you'll find
that no audience can miss it." It is a comfort to add that
it was instantly seized upon, and is much talked of.</p>

<p>Stanfield was very ill for some months, then suddenly
picked up, and is really rosy and jovial again. Going to
see him when he was very despondent, I told him the story
of Fechter's piece (then in rehearsal) with appropriate
action; fighting a duel with the washing-stand, defying
the bedstead, and saving the life of the sofa-cushion. This
so kindled his old theatrical ardour, that I think he turned
the corner on the spot.</p>

<p>With love to Mrs. Macready and Katie, and (be still my
heart!) Benvenuta, and the exiled Johnny (not too attentive
at school, I hope?), and the personally-unknown young
Parr,</p>

<small>THE TIME OF THE PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S ARRIVAL IN LONDON.</small></div>

<p>It is curious to see London gone mad. Down in the
Strand here, the monomaniacal tricks it is playing are
grievous to behold, but along Fleet Street and Cheapside it
gradually becomes frenzied, dressing itself up in all sorts
of odds and ends, and knocking itself about in a most
amazing manner. At London Bridge it raves, principally
about the Kings of Denmark and their portraits. I have
been looking among them for Hamlet's uncle, and have
discovered one personage with a high nose, who I think is
the man.</p>

little cheek against the window glass in a dreary little way

she didn't think "that the Tower of Babel was a great

from St. James's Hall to the Hanover Square Room. The

the least inflection will tell anywhere in the place exactly

enormous van, at a cost of five pounds, and we started in
majesty from the office in London, fourteen strong. We
crossed Waterloo Bridge with the happy design of beginning
the sight at London Bridge, and working our way
through the City to Regent Street. In a by-street in the
Borough, over against a dead wall and under a railway
bridge, we were blocked for four hours. We were obliged
to walk home at last, having seen nothing whatever. The
wretched van turned up in the course of the next morning;
and the best of it was that at Rochester here they illuminated
the fine old castle, and really made a very splendid and

<div class='center'><small>ON THE DEATH OF MR. EGG.</small><br /><br />

<small>EXTRACT.</small></div>

<p>Ah, poor Egg! I knew what you would think and feel
about it. When we saw him in Paris on his way out I was
struck by his extreme nervousness, and derived from it an
uneasy foreboding of his state. What a large piece of a
good many years he seems to have taken with him! How
often have I thought, since the news of his death came, of
his putting his part in the saucepan (with the cover on)
when we rehearsed "The Lighthouse;" of his falling out of
the hammock when we rehearsed "The Frozen Deep;"
of his learning Italian numbers when he ate the garlic in
the carriage; of the thousands (I was going to say) of dark
mornings when I apostrophised him as "Kernel;" of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
losing my invaluable knife in that beastly stage-coach; of
his posting up that mysterious book<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> every night! I
hardly know why, but I have always associated that volume
most with Venice. In my memory of the dear gentle little
fellow, he will be (as since those days he always has been)
eternally posting up that book at the large table in the
middle of our Venice sitting-room, incidentally asking the
name of an hotel three weeks back! And his pretty house
is to be laid waste and sold. If there be a sale on the spot
I shall try to buy something in loving remembrance of him,
good dear little fellow. Think what a great "Frozen
Deep" lay close under those boards we acted on! My
brother Alfred, Luard, Arthur, Albert, Austin, Egg. Even
among the audience, Prince Albert and poor Stone! "I
heard the"&mdash;I forget what it was I used to say&mdash;"come up
from the great deep;" and it rings in my ears now, like a
sort of mad prophecy.</p>

<p>However, this won't do. We must close up the ranks
and march on.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that you may perhaps know, or know
of, a kind of man that I want to discover.</p>

<p>One of my boys (the youngest) now is at Wimbledon
School. He is a docile, amiable boy of fair abilities, but
sensitive and shy. And he writes me so very earnestly that
he feels the school to be confusingly large for him, and that
he is sure he could do better with some gentleman who gave
his own personal attention to the education of half-a-dozen
or a dozen boys, as to impress me with the belief that I ought
to heed his conviction.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>Has any such phenomenon as a good and reliable man
in this wise ever come in your way? Forgive my troubling
you, and believe me,</p>

<div class='sig'>
Cordially yours.<br />

<p>I am most truly obliged to you for your kind and
ready help.</p>

<p>When I am in town next week, I will call upon the
Bishop of Natal, more to thank him than with the hope of
profiting by that gentleman of whom he writes, as the limitation
to "little boys" seems to stop the way. I want to
find someone with whom this particular boy could remain;
if there were a mutual interest and liking, that would be a
great point gained.</p>

<p>Why did the kings in the fairy tales want children? I
suppose in the weakness of the royal intellect.</p>

<p>Concerning "Nickleby," I am so much of your mind
(comparing it with "Copperfield"), that it was a long time
before I could take a pleasure in reading it. But I got
better, as I found the audience always taking to it. I have
been trying, alone by myself, the "Oliver Twist" murder, but
have got something so horrible out of it that I am afraid to
try it in public.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>I don't wonder at your finding it difficult to reconcile
your mind to a French Hamlet; but I assure you that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Fechter's is a very remarkable performance perfectly consistent
with itself (whether it be my particular Hamlet,
or your particular Hamlet, or no), a coherent and intelligent
whole, and done by a true artist. I have never seen,
I think, an intelligent and clear view of the whole character
so well sustained throughout; and there is a very captivating
air of romance and picturesqueness added, which is
quite new. Rely upon it, the public were right. The thing
could not have been sustained by oddity; it would have
perished upon that, very soon. As to the mere accent,
there is far less drawback in that than you would suppose.
For this reason, he obviously knows English so thoroughly
that you feel he is safe. You are never in pain for him.
This sense of ease is gained directly, and then you think
very little more about it.</p>

<p>The Colenso and Jowett matter is a more difficult question,
but here again I don't go with you. The position of
the writers of "Essays and Reviews" is, that certain parts
of the Old Testament have done their intended function in
the education of the world <i>as it was;</i> but that mankind, like
the individual man, is designed by the Almighty to have
an infancy and a maturity, and that as it advances, the
machinery of its education must advance too. For example:
inasmuch as ever since there was a sun and there was
vapour, there <i>must have</i> been a rainbow under certain
conditions, so surely it would be better now to recognise
that indisputable fact. Similarly, Joshua might command
the sun to stand still, under the impression that it moved
round the earth; but he could not possibly have inverted
the relations of the earth and the sun, whatever his
impressions were. Again, it is contended that the science
of geology is quite as much a revelation to man, as books
of an immense age and of (at the best) doubtful origin, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that your consideration of the latter must reasonably be
influenced by the former. As I understand the importance
of timely suggestions such as these, it is, that the Church
should not gradually shock and lose the more thoughtful
and logical of human minds; but should be so gently and
considerately yielding as to retain them, and, through them,
hundreds of thousands. This seems to me, as I understand
the temper and tendency of the time, whether for good or
evil, to be a very wise and necessary position. And as I
understand the danger, it is not chargeable on those who
take this ground, but on those who in reply call names and
argue nothing. What these bishops and such-like say
about revelation, in assuming it to be finished and done
with, I can't in the least understand. Nothing is discovered
without God's intention and assistance, and I suppose every
new knowledge of His works that is conceded to man to be
distinctly a revelation by which men are to guide themselves.
Lastly, in the mere matter of religious doctrine and dogmas,
these men (Protestants&mdash;protestors&mdash;successors of the men
who protested against human judgment being set aside) talk
and write as if they were all settled by the direct act of
Heaven; not as if they had been, as we know they were, a
matter of temporary accommodation and adjustment among
disputing mortals as fallible as you or I.</p>

<p>Coming nearer home, I hope that Georgina is almost
quite well. She has no attack of pain or flurry now, and is
in all respects immensely better. Mary is neither married
nor (that I know of) going to be. She and Katie and a lot
of them have been playing croquet outside my window here
for these last four days, to a mad and maddening extent.
My sailor-boy's ship, the <i>Orlando</i>, is fortunately in Chatham
Dockyard&mdash;so he is pretty constantly at home&mdash;while the
shipwrights are repairing a leak in her. I am reading in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
London every Friday just now. Great crams and great
enthusiasm. Townshend I suppose to have left Lausanne
somewhere about this day. His house in the park is hermetically
sealed, ready for him. The Prince and Princess
of Wales go about (wisely) very much, and have as fair a
chance of popularity as ever prince and princess had. The
City ball in their honour is to be a tremendously gorgeous
business, and Mary is highly excited by her father's being
invited, and she with him. Meantime the unworthy parent
is devising all kinds of subterfuges for sending her and
getting out of it himself. A very intelligent German friend
of mine, just home from America, maintains that the conscription
will succeed in the North, and that the war will be
indefinitely prolonged. <i>I</i> say "No," and that however mad
and villainous the North is, the war will finish by reason of
its not supplying soldiers. We shall see. The more they
brag the more I don't believe in them.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Madam</span>,</div>

<p>I hope you will excuse this tardy reply to your letter.
It is often impossible for me, by any means, to keep pace
with my correspondents. I must take leave to say, that if
there be any general feeling on the part of the intelligent
Jewish people, that I have done them what you describe as
"a great wrong," they are a far less sensible, a far less just,
and a far less good-tempered people than I have always
supposed them to be. Fagin, in "Oliver Twist," is a Jew,
because it unfortunately was true of the time to which that
story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably
was a Jew. But surely no sensible man or woman of your
persuasion can fail to observe&mdash;firstly, that all the rest of
the wicked <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> are Christians; and secondly,
that he is called the "Jew," not because of his religion, but
because of his race. If I were to write a story, in which
I described a Frenchman or a Spaniard as "the Roman
Catholic," I should do a very indecent and unjustifiable
thing; but I make mention of Fagin as the Jew, because he
is one of the Jewish people, and because it conveys that
kind of idea of him which I should give my readers of a
Chinaman, by calling him a Chinese.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>The enclosed is quite a nominal subscription towards the
good object in which you are interested; but I hope it may
serve to show you that I have no feeling towards the Jewish
people but a friendly one. I always speak well of them,
whether in public or in private, and bear my testimony (as
I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions
as I have ever had with them; and in my "Child's
History of England," I have lost no opportunity of setting
forth their cruel persecution in old times.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Dear Madam, faithfully yours.<br />
</div>


<p>In reply to this, the Jewish lady thanks him for
his kind letter and its enclosure, still remonstrating and
pointing out that though, as he observes, "all the other
criminal characters were Christians, they are, at least, contrasted
with characters of good Christians; this wretched
Fagin stands alone as the Jew."</p>

<p>The reply to <i>this</i> letter afterwards was the character
of Riah, in "Our Mutual Friend," and some favourable
sketches of Jewish character in the lower class, in some
articles in "All the Year Round."</p>

dying fast, and all the old faults had faded out of him, and
the now ghost of the handsome man I had first known
when Scott's daughter was at the head of his house, had
little more to do with this world than she in her grave, or
Scott in his, or small Hugh Littlejohn in his. Lockhart
had been anxious to see me all the previous day (when I
was away on the Campagna), and as we walked about I
knew very well that <i>he</i> knew very well why. He talked of

<h2>1864.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Charles Dickens</span> was, as usual, at Gad's Hill, with a family
and friendly party, at the opening of this year, and had
been much shocked and distressed by the news of the
sudden death of Mr. Thackeray, brought to him by friends
arriving from London on the Christmas Eve of 1863, the
day on which the sad event happened. He writes of it, in
the first letter of the year, to Mr. Wilkie Collins, who was
passing the winter in Italy. He tells him, also, of his
having got well to work upon a new serial story, the first
number of which ("Our Mutual Friend") was published on
the 1st of May.</div>

<p>The year began very sadly for Charles Dickens. On the
7th of February (his own birthday) he received the mournful
announcement of the death of his second son, Walter Landor
(a lieutenant in the 42nd Royal Highlanders), who had died
quite suddenly at Calcutta, on the last night of the year of
1863, at the age of twenty-three. His third son, Francis
Jeffrey, had started for India at the end of January.</p>

<p>His annual letter to M. de Cerjat contains an allusion to
"another generation beginning to peep above the table"&mdash;the
children of his son Charles, who had been married
three years before, to Miss Bessie Evans.</p>

<p>In the middle of February he removed to a house in
London (57, Gloucester Place, Hyde Park), where he made a
stay of the usual duration, up to the middle of June, all the
time being hard at work upon "Our Mutual Friend" and
"All the Year Round." Mr. Marcus Stone was the illustrator
of the new monthly work, and we give a specimen of one of
many letters which he wrote to him about his "subjects."</p>

<p>His old friend, Mr. Charles Knight, with whom for many
years Charles Dickens had dined on his birthday, was staying,
this spring, in the Isle of Wight. To him he writes of the
death of Walter, and of another sad death which happened
at this time, and which affected him almost as much. Clara,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the last surviving daughter of Mr. and Mrs. White, who had
been happily married to Mr. Gordon, of Cluny, not more
than two years, had just died at Bonchurch. Her father,
as will be seen by the touching allusion to him in this letter,
had died a short time after this daughter's marriage.</p>

<p>A letter to Mr. Edmund Ollier has reference to certain
additions which Charles Dickens wished him to make to an
article (by Mr. Ollier) on Working Men's Clubs, published
in "All the Year Round."</p>

<p>We are glad to have one letter to the Lord Chief Baron,
Sir Frederick Pollock, which shows the great friendship and
regard Charles Dickens had for him, and his admiration of
his qualities in his judicial capacity.</p>

<p>We give a pleasant letter to Mrs. Storrar, for whom,
and for her husband, Dr. Storrar, Charles Dickens had affectionate
regard, because we are glad to have their names
in our book. The letter speaks for itself and needs no
explanation.</p>

<p>The latter part of the year was uneventful. Hard at
work, he passed the summer and autumn at Gad's Hill,
taking holidays by receiving visitors at home (among them,
this year, Sir J. Emerson Tennent, his wife and daughter,
who were kindly urgent for his paying them a return visit
in Ireland) and occasional "runs" into France. The last
letters we give are his annual one to M. de Cerjat, and a
graceful little New Year's note to his dear old friend
"Barry Cornwall."</p>

<p>The Christmas number was "Mrs. Lirriper's Legacy,"
the first and last part written by himself, as in the case of
the previous year's "Mrs. Lirriper."</p>

<div class='center'><small>EXTRACT.</small></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wilkie</span>,</div>

<p>I am horribly behindhand in answering your welcome
letter; but I have been so busy, and have had the
house so full for Christmas and the New Year, and have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
so much to see to in getting Frank out to India, that I have
not been able to settle down to a regular long letter, which
I mean this to be, but which it may not turn out to be,
after all.</p>

<p>First, I will answer your enquiries about the Christmas
number and the new book. The Christmas number has
been the greatest success of all; has shot ahead of last
year; has sold about two hundred and twenty thousand;
and has made the name of Mrs. Lirriper so swiftly and
domestically famous as never was. I had a very strong
belief in her when I wrote about her, finding that she made
a great effect upon me; but she certainly has gone beyond
my hopes. (Probably you know nothing about her? which
is a very unpleasant consideration.) Of the new book, I
have done the two first numbers, and am now beginning
the third. It is a combination of drollery with romance
which requires a great deal of pains and a perfect throwing
away of points that might be amplified; but I hope it is
<i>very good</i>. I confess, in short, that I think it is. Strange
to say, I felt at first quite dazed in getting back to the large
canvas and the big brushes; and even now, I have a sensation
as of acting at the San Carlo after Tavistock House,
which I could hardly have supposed would have come upon
so old a stager.</p>

<p>You will have read about poor Thackeray's death&mdash;sudden,
and yet not sudden, for he had long been alarmingly
ill. At the solicitation of Mr. Smith and some of his
friends, I have done what I would most gladly have excused
myself from doing, if I felt I could&mdash;written a couple of
pages about him in what was his own magazine.</p>

<p>Concerning the Italian experiment, De la Rue is more
hopeful than you. He and his bank are closely leagued
with the powers at Turin, and he has long been devoted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Cavour; but he gave me the strongest assurances (with
illustrations) of the fusion between place and place, and of
the blending of small mutually antagonistic characters into
one national character, progressing cheeringly and certainly.
Of course there must be discouragements and discrepancies
in the first struggles of a country previously so degraded
and enslaved, and the time, as yet, has been very short.</p>

<p>I should like to have a day with you at the Coliseum,
and on the Appian Way, and among the tombs, and with
the Orvieto. But Rome and I are wide asunder, physically
as well as morally. I wonder whether the dramatic stable,
where we saw the marionettes, still receives the Roman
public? And Lord! when I think of you in that hotel, how
I think of poor dear Egg in the long front drawing-room,
giving on to the piazza, posting up that wonderful necromantic
volume which we never shall see opened!</p>

<p>I think the design for the cover <i>excellent</i>, and do not
doubt its coming out to perfection. The slight alteration I
am going to suggest originates in a business consideration
not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The word "Our" in the title must be out in the open
like "Mutual Friend," making the title three distinct large
lines&mdash;"Our" as big as "Mutual Friend." This would
give you too much design at the bottom. I would therefore
take out the dustman, and put the Wegg and Boffin composition
(which is capital) in its place. I don't want
Mr. Inspector or the murder reward bill, because these
points are sufficiently indicated in the river at the top.
Therefore you can have an indication of the dustman in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Mr. Inspector's place. Note, that the dustman's face
should be droll, and not horrible. Twemlow's elbow will
still go out of the frame as it does now, and the same with
Lizzie's skirts on the opposite side. With these changes,
work away!</p>

<p>Mrs. Boffin, as I judge of her from the sketch, "very
good, indeed." I want Boffin's oddity, without being at all
blinked, to be an oddity of a very honest kind, that people
will like.</p>

<p>The doll's dressmaker is immensely better than she was.
I think she should now come extremely well. A weird sharpness
not without beauty is the thing I want.</p>

mouth, and was dead. His brother Frank would arrive out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

<p>I want the article on "Working Men's Clubs" to refer
back to "The Poor Man and his Beer" in No. 1, and to
maintain the principle involved in that effort.</p>

<p>Also, emphatically, to show that trustfulness is at the
bottom of all social institutions, and that to trust a man, as
one of a body of men, is to place him under a wholesome
restraint of social opinion, and is a very much better thing
than to make a baby of him.</p>

<p>Also, to point out that the rejection of beer in this club,
tobacco in that club, dancing or what-not in another club,
are instances that such clubs are founded on mere whims,
and therefore cannot successfully address human nature in
the general, and hope to last.</p>

<p>Also, again to urge that patronage is the curse and
blight of all such endeavours, and to impress upon the
working men that they must originate and manage for
themselves. And to ask them the question, can they possibly
show their detestation of drunkenness better, or better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
strive to get rid of it from among them, than to make it a
hopeless disqualification in all their clubs, and a reason for
expulsion.</p>

<p>Also, to encourage them to declare to themselves and
their fellow working men that they want social rest and
social recreation for themselves and their families; and that
these clubs are intended for that laudable and necessary
purpose, and do not need educational pretences or flourishes.
Do not let them be afraid or ashamed of wanting to be
amused and pleased.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Chief Baron</span>,</div>

<p>Many thanks for your kind letter, which I find on my
return from a week's holiday.</p>

<p>Your answer concerning poor Thackeray I will duly
make known to the active spirit in that matter, Mr. Shirley
Brooks.</p>

<p>Your kind invitation to me to come and see you and
yours, and hear the nightingales, I shall not fail to discuss
with Forster, and with an eye to spring. I expect to see
him presently; the rather as I found a note from him
when I came back yesterday, describing himself somewhat
gloomily as not having been well, and as feeling a little out
of heart.</p>

<p>It is not out of order, I hope, to remark that you have
been much in my thoughts and on my lips lately? For I
really have not been able to repress my admiration of the
vigorous dignity and sense and spirit, with which one of the
best of judges set right one of the dullest of juries in a
recent case.</p>

<p>I meant to write to you last night, but to enable
Wills to get away I had to read a book of Fitzgerald's
through before I went to bed.</p>

<p>Concerning Eliot, I sat down, as I told you, and read
the book through with the strangest interest and the
highest admiration. I believe it to be as honest, spirited,
patient, reliable, and gallant a piece of biography as ever
was written, the care and pains of it astonishing, the completeness
of it masterly; and what I particularly feel about
it is that the dignity of the man, and the dignity of the
book that tells about the man, always go together, and fit
each other. This same quality has always impressed me as
the great leading speciality of the Goldsmith, and enjoins
sympathy with the subject, knowledge of it, and pursuit of
it in its own spirit; but I think it even more remarkable
here. I declare that apart from the interest of having been
so put into the time, and enabled to understand it, I personally
feel quite as much the credit and honour done to
literature by such a book. It quite clears out of the
remembrance a thousand pitiful things, and sets one up in
heart again. I am not surprised in the least by Bulwer's
enthusiasm. I was as confident about the effect of the book
when I closed the first volume, as I was when I closed the
second with a full heart. No man less in earnest than Eliot
himself could have done it, and I make bold to add that it
never could have been done by a man who was so distinctly
born to do the work as Eliot was to do his.</p>

<p>Saturday at Hastings I must give up. I have wavered
and considered, and considered and wavered, but if I take
that sort of holiday, I must have a day to spare after it,
and at this critical time I have not. If I were to lose a page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the five numbers I have purposed to myself to be ready
by the publication day, I should feel that I had fallen short.
I have grown hard to satisfy, and write very slowly, and I
have so much bad fiction, that <i>will</i> be thought of when I
don't want to think of it, that I am forced to take more
care than I ever took.</p>

<p>Our family dinner must come off at Gad's Hill, where
I have improvements to exhibit, and where I shall be truly
pleased to see you and the doctor again. I have deferred
answering your note, while I have been scheming and
scheming for a day between this time and our departure.
But it is all in vain. My engagements have accumulated,
and become such a whirl, that no day is left me. Nothing
is left me but to get away. I look forward to my release
from this dining life with an inexpressible longing after
quiet and my own pursuits. What with public speechifying,
private eating and drinking, and perpetual simmering in hot
rooms, I have made London too hot to hold me and my work
together. Mary and Georgina acknowledge the condition of
imbecility to which we have become reduced in reference to
your kind reminder. They say, when I stare at them in a
forlorn way with your note in my hand: "What <span class="smcap">can</span> you
do!" To which I can only reply, implicating them: "See
what you have brought me to!"</p>

<p>With our united kind regard to yourself and Dr. Storrar,
I entreat your pity and compassion for an unfortunate wretch
whom a too-confiding disposition has brought to this pass. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
I had not allowed my "cheeild" to pledge me to all manner

<p>First, let me assure you that it gave us all real pleasure
to see your sister and you at Gad's Hill, and that we
all hope you will both come and stay a day or two with us
when you are next in England.</p>

<p>Next, let me convey to you the intelligence that I resolve
to launch "Miss Manuel," fully confiding in your conviction
of the power of the story. On all business points,
Wills will communicate with you. I purpose beginning its
publication in our first September number, therefore there
is no time to be lost.</p>

<p>The only suggestion I have to make as to the MS. in
hand and type is, that Captain Fermor wants relief. It is a
disagreeable character, as you mean it to be, and I should
be afraid to do so much with him, if the case were mine,
without taking the taste of him, here and there, out of the
reader's mouth. It is remarkable that if you do not administer
a disagreeable character carefully, the public have
a decided tendency to think that the <i>story</i> is disagreeable,
and not merely the fictitious person.</p>

<p>What do you think of the title,</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Never Forgotten?</span><br />
</div>

<p>It is a good one in itself, would express the eldest sister's

<i>Friday, Aug. 26th, 1864.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Tennent</span>,</div>

<p>Believe me, I fully intended to come to you&mdash;did not
doubt that I should come&mdash;and have greatly disappointed
Mary and her aunt, as well as myself, by not coming. But
I do not feel safe in going out for a visit. The mere
knowledge that I had such a thing before me would put
me out. It is not the length of time consumed, or the
distance traversed, but it is the departure from a settled
habit and a continuous sacrifice of pleasures that comes in
question. This is an old story with me. I have never
divided a book of my writing with anything else, but have
always wrought at it to the exclusion of everything else;
and it is now too late to change.</p>

<p>After receiving your kind note I resolved to make
another trial. But the hot weather and a few other drawbacks
did not mend the matter, for I have dropped astern
this month instead of going ahead. So I have seen Forster,
and shown him my chains, and am reduced to taking
exercise in them, like Baron Trenck.</p>

<p>I am heartily pleased that you set so much store by the
dedication. You may be sure that it does not make me
the less anxious to take pains, and to work out well what I
have in my mind.</p>

<p>Mary and Georgina unite with me in kindest regards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to Lady Tennent and Miss Tennent, and wish me to report
that while they are seriously disappointed, they still feel
there is no help for it. I can testify that they had great
pleasure in the anticipation of the visit, and that their faces
were very long and blank indeed when I began to hint my
doubts. They fought against them valiantly as long as
there was a chance, but they see my difficulty as well as
anyone not myself can.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>Here is a limping brute of a reply to your always-welcome
Christmas letter! But, as usual, when I have done
my day's work, I jump up from my desk and rush into air
and exercise, and find letter-writing the most difficult thing
in my daily life.</p>

<p>I hope that your asthmatic tendencies may not be
strong just now; but Townshend's account of the premature
winter at Lausanne is not encouraging, and with us here
in England all such disorders have been aggravated this
autumn. However, a man of your dignity <i>must</i> have either
asthma or gout, and I hope you have got the better of the
two.</p>

<p>In London there is, as you see by the papers, extraordinarily
little news. At present the apprehension (rather
less than it was thought) of a commercial crisis, and the trial
of M&uuml;ller next Thursday, are the two chief sensations. I
hope that gentleman will be hanged, and have hardly a
doubt of it, though croakers contrariwise are not wanting.
It is difficult to conceive any other line of defence than
that the circumstances proved, taken separately, are slight.
But a sound judge will immediately charge the jury that
the strength of the circumstances lies in their being put
together, and will thread them together on a fatal rope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the Church, my friend, I am sick of it. The
spectacle presented by the indecent squabbles of priests of
most denominations, and the exemplary unfairness and
rancour with which they conduct their differences, utterly
repel me. And the idea of the Protestant establishment,
in the face of its own history, seeking to trample out discussion
and private judgment, is an enormity so cool, that I
wonder the Right Reverends, Very Reverends, and all other
Reverends, who commit it, can look in one another's faces
without laughing, as the old soothsayers did. Perhaps
they can't and don't. How our sublime and so-different
Christian religion is to be administered in the future I
cannot pretend to say, but that the Church's hand is at
its own throat I am fully convinced. Here, more Popery,
there, more Methodism&mdash;as many forms of consignment to
eternal damnation as there are articles, and all in one forever
quarrelling body&mdash;the Master of the New Testament put
out of sight, and the rage and fury almost always turning
on the letter of obscure parts of the Old Testament, which
itself has been the subject of accommodation, adaptation,
varying interpretation without end&mdash;these things cannot last.
The Church that is to have its part in the coming time must
be a more Christian one, with less arbitrary pretensions and
a stronger hold upon the mantle of our Saviour, as He
walked and talked upon this earth.</p>

<p>Of family intelligence I have very little. Charles
Collins continuing in a very poor way, and showing no
signs of amendment. He and my daughter Katie went to
Wiesbaden and thence to Nice, where they are now. I
have strong apprehensions that he will never recover, and
that she will be left a young widow. All the rest are as they
were. Mary neither married nor going to be; Georgina
holding them all together and perpetually corresponding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with the distant ones; occasional rallyings coming off here,
in which another generation begins to peep above the table.
I once used to think what a horrible thing it was to be a
grandfather. Finding that the calamity falls upon me
without my perceiving any other change in myself, I bear it
like a man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson has bought a house in town, to which she
repairs in the season, for the bringing out of her daughter.
She is now at Rockingham. Her eldest son is said to be
as good an eldest son as ever was, and to make her position
there a perfectly independent and happy one. I have not
seen him for some years; her I often see; but he ought to
be a good fellow, and is very popular in his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have altered this place very much since you were here,
and have made a pretty (I think an unusually pretty) drawing-room.
I wish you would come back and see it. My
being on the Dover line, and my being very fond of France,
occasion me to cross the Channel perpetually. Whenever
I feel that I have worked too much, or am on the eve of overdoing
it, and want a change, away I go by the mail-train,
and turn up in Paris or anywhere else that suits my
humour, next morning. So I come back as fresh as a
daisy, and preserve as ruddy a face as though I never leant
over a sheet of paper. When I retire from a literary life I
think of setting up as a Channel pilot.</p>

<p>Pray give my love to Mrs. Cerjat, and tell her that I
should like to go up the Great St. Bernard again, and shall
be glad to know if she is open to another ascent. Old
days in Switzerland are ever fresh to me, and sometimes
I walk with you again, after dark, outside the hotel at
Martigny, while Lady Mary Taylour (wasn't it?) sang
within very prettily. Lord, how the time goes! How
many years ago!</p>

<h2>1865.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>For</span> this spring a furnished house in Somer's Place, Hyde
Park, had been taken, which Charles Dickens occupied, with
his sister-in-law and daughter, from the beginning of March
until June.</div>

<p>During the year he paid two short visits to France.</p>

<p>He was still at work upon "Our Mutual Friend," two
numbers of which had been issued in January and February,
when the first volume was published, with dedication to Sir
James Emerson Tennent. The remaining numbers were
issued between March and November, when the complete
work was published in two volumes.</p>

<p>The Christmas number, to which Charles Dickens contributed
three stories, was called "Doctor Marigold's
Prescriptions."</p>

<p>Being out of health, and much overworked, Charles
Dickens, at the end of May, took his first short holiday trip
into France. And on his way home, and on a day afterwards
so fatal to him, the 9th of June, he was in that
most terrible railway accident at Staplehurst. Many of our
letters for this year have reference to this awful experience&mdash;an
experience from the effects of which his nerves never
wholly recovered. His letters to Mr. Thomas Mitton and
to Mrs. Hulkes (an esteemed friend and neighbour) are
graphic descriptions of this disaster. But they do <span class="smcap">not</span> tell
of the wonderful presence of mind and energy shown by
Charles Dickens when most of the terrified passengers were
incapable of thought or action, or of his gentleness and
goodness to the dead and dying. The Mr. Dickenson<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> mentioned
in the letter to Mrs. Hulkes soon recovered. He
always considers that he owes his life to Charles Dickens,
the latter having discovered and extricated him from beneath
a carriage before it was too late.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>Our first letter to Mr. Kent is one of congratulation upon
his having become the proprietor of <i>The Sun</i> newspaper.</p>

<p>Professor Owen has been so kind as to give us some
notes, which we publish for the sake of his great name.
Charles Dickens had not much correspondence with Professor
Owen, but there was a firm friendship and great
mutual admiration between them.</p>

<p>The letter to Mrs. Procter is in answer to one from her,
asking Charles Dickens to write a memoir of her daughter
Adelaide, as a preface to a collected edition of her poems.</p>

<p>I meant to have written instantly on the appearance
of your paper in its beautiful freshness, to congratulate you
on its handsome appearance, and to send you my heartiest
good wishes for its thriving and prosperous career. Through
a mistake of the postman's, that remarkable letter has been
tesselated into the Infernal Pavement instead of being
delivered in the Strand.</p>

<p>We have been looking and waiting for your being well
enough to propose yourself for a mouthful of fresh air. Are
you well enough to come on Sunday? We shall be coming
down from Charing Cross on Sunday morning, and I shall
be going up again at nine on Monday morning.</p>

<p>It amuses me to find that you don't see your way with a
certain "Mutual Friend" of ours. I have a horrible suspicion
that you may begin to be fearfully knowing at somewhere
about No. 12 or 13. But you shan't if I can help it.</p>

<p>Your note delighted me because it dwelt upon the places

I will do it, and with all my heart.</p>

<p>I have registered a vow (in which there is not the least

very hard at work upon a book, I never will dine out more
than one day in a week. Why didn't you ask me for the
Wednesday, before I stood engaged to Lady Molesworth
for the Tuesday?</p>

<p>It is so delightful to me to sit by your side anywhere
and be brightened up, that I lay a handsome sacrifice upon
the altar of "Our Mutual Friend" in writing this note,
very much against my will. But for as many years as can
be made consistent with my present juvenility, I always
have given my work the first place in my life, and what can

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Macready</span>,</div>

<p>A thousand thanks for your kind letter, most heartily
welcome.</p>

<p>My frost-bitten foot, after causing me great inconvenience
and much pain, has begun to conduct itself
amiably. I can now again walk my ten miles in the morning
without inconvenience, but am absurdly obliged to sit shoeless
all the evening&mdash;a very slight penalty, as I detest going
out to dinner (which killed the original old Parr by-the-bye).</p>

<p>I am working like a dragon at my book, and am a terror
to the household, likewise to all the organs and brass bands
in this quarter. Gad's Hill is being gorgeously painted,
and we are here until the 1st of June. I wish I might
hope you would be there any time this summer; I really
<i>have</i> made the place comfortable and pretty by this time.</p>

<p>It is delightful to us to hear such good news of Butty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
She made so deep an impression on Fechter that he always
asks me what Ceylon has done for her, and always beams
when I tell him how thoroughly well it has made her. As
to <i>you</i>, you are the youngest man (worth mentioning as a
thorough man) that I know. Oh, let me be as young when
I am as&mdash;&mdash;did you think I was going to write "old?"
No, sir&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'withdraw'">withdrawn</ins> from the wear and tear of busy life is
my expression.</p>

<p>Poole still holds out at Kentish Town, and says he is
dying of solitude. His memory is astoundingly good. I
see him about once in two or three months, and in the
meantime he makes notes of questions to ask me when I
come. Having fallen in arrear of the time, these generally
refer to unknown words he has encountered in the newspapers.
His three last (he always reads them with tremendous
difficulty through an enormous magnifying-glass)
were as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
1. What's croquet?<br />
2. What's an Albert chain?<br />
3. Let me know the state of mind of the Queen.<br />
</div>

<p>When I had delivered a neat exposition on these heads,
he turned back to his memoranda, and came to something
that the utmost power of the enormous magnifying-glass
couldn't render legible. After a quarter of an hour or so,
he said: "O yes, I know." And then rose and clasped
his hands above his head, and said: "Thank God, I am not
a dram-drinker."</p>

<p>Do think of coming to Gad's in the summer; and do give
my love to Mrs. Macready, and tell her I know she can
make you come if she will. Mary and Georgy send best
and dearest loves to her, to you, and to Katie, and to baby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

<i>Tuesday, June 13th, 1865.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mitton</span>,</div>

<p>I should have written to you yesterday or the day
before, if I had been quite up to writing.</p>

<p>I was in the only carriage that did not go over into the
stream. It was caught upon the turn by some of the ruin
of the bridge, and hung suspended and balanced in an
apparently impossible manner. Two ladies were my fellow-passengers,
an old one and a young one. This is exactly
what passed. You may judge from it the precise length of
the suspense: Suddenly we were off the rail, and beating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the ground as the car of a half-emptied balloon might.
The old lady cried out, "My God!" and the young one
screamed. I caught hold of them both (the old lady sat
opposite and the young one on my left), and said: "We can't
help ourselves, but we can be quiet and composed. Pray
don't cry out." The old lady immediately answered: "Thank
you. Rely upon me. Upon my soul I will be quiet." We
were then all tilted down together in a corner of the carriage,
and stopped. I said to them thereupon: "You may be sure
nothing worse can happen. Our danger <i>must</i> be over.
Will you remain here without stirring, while I get out of
the window?" They both answered quite collectedly,
"Yes," and I got out without the least notion what had
happened. Fortunately I got out with great caution and
stood upon the step. Looking down I saw the bridge gone,
and nothing below me but the line of rail. Some people in
the two other compartments were madly trying to plunge
out at window, and had no idea that there was an open
swampy field fifteen feet down below them, and nothing
else! The two guards (one with his face cut) were running
up and down on the down side of the bridge (which was not
torn up) quite wildly. I called out to them: "Look at me.
Do stop an instant and look at me, and tell me whether you
don't know me." One of them answered: "We know you
very well, Mr. Dickens." "Then," I said, "my good fellow,
for God's sake give me your key, and send one of those
labourers here, and I'll empty this carriage." We did it
quite safely, by means of a plank or two, and when it was
done I saw all the rest of the train, except the two baggage
vans, down in the stream. I got into the carriage again for
my brandy flask, took off my travelling hat for a basin,
climbed down the brickwork, and filled my hat with
water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly I came upon a staggering man covered with
blood (I think he must have been flung clean out of his
carriage), with such a frightful cut across the skull that I
couldn't bear to look at him. I poured some water over his
face and gave him some to drink, then gave him some
brandy, and laid him down on the grass, and he said, "I am
gone," and died afterwards. Then I stumbled over a lady
lying on her back against a little pollard-tree, with the
blood streaming over her face (which was lead colour) in a
number of distinct little streams from the head. I asked
her if she could swallow a little brandy and she just nodded,
and I gave her some and left her for somebody else. The
next time I passed her she was dead. Then a man,
examined at the inquest yesterday (who evidently had not
the least remembrance of what really passed), came running
up to me and implored me to help him find his wife, who
was afterwards found dead. No imagination can conceive
the ruin of the carriages, or the extraordinary weights
under which the people were lying, or the complications
into which they were twisted up among iron and wood, and
mud and water.</p>

<p>I don't want to be examined at the inquest, and I don't
want to write about it. I could do no good either way, and
I could only seem to speak about myself, which, of course,
I would rather not do. I am keeping very quiet here. I
have a&mdash;I don't know what to call it&mdash;constitutional (I
suppose) presence of mind, and was not in the least fluttered
at the time. I instantly remembered that I had the MS. of
a number with me, and clambered back into the carriage
for it. But in writing these scanty words of recollection I
feel the shake and am obliged to stop.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Hulkes</span>,</div>

<p>I return the <i>Examiner</i> with many thanks. The
account is true, except that I <i>had</i> brandy. By an extraordinary
chance I had a bottle and a half with me. I slung
the half-bottle round my neck, and carried my hat full of
water in my hands. But I can understand the describer
(whoever he is) making the mistake in perfect good faith,
and supposing that I called for brandy, when I really called
to the others who were helping: "I have brandy here."
The Mr. Dickenson mentioned had changed places with a
Frenchman, who did not like the window down, a few
minutes before the accident. The Frenchman was killed,
and a labourer and I got Mr. Dickenson out of a most
extraordinary heap of dark ruins, in which he was jammed
upside down. He was bleeding at the eyes, ears, nose,
and mouth; but he didn't seem to know that afterwards,
and of course I didn't tell him. In the moment of going
over the viaduct the whole of his pockets were shaken
empty! He had no watch, no chain, no money, no pocket-book,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
no handkerchief, when we got him out. He had
been choking a quarter of an hour when I heard him groaning.
If I had not had the brandy to give him at the
moment, I think he would have been done for. As it was,
I brought him up to London in the carriage with me, and
couldn't make him believe he was hurt. He was the first
person whom the brandy saved. As I ran back to the
carriage for the whole full bottle, I saw the first two people
I had helped lying dead. A bit of shade from the hot sun,
into which we got the unhurt ladies, soon had as many dead
in it as living.</p>

<p>I need not assure you that I regard the unanimous
desire of the Town Council Committee as a great honour,
and that I feel the strongest interest in the occasion, and
the strongest wish to associate myself with it.</p>

<p>But, after careful consideration, I most unwillingly come
to the conclusion that I must decline. At the time in
question I shall, please God, either have just finished, or be
just finishing, my present book. Country rest and reflection
will then be invaluable to me, before casting about for
Christmas. I am a little shaken in my nervous system by
the terrible and affecting incidents of the late railway
accident, from which I bodily escaped. I am withdrawing
myself from engagements of all kinds, in order that I may
pursue my story with the comfortable sense of being
perfectly free while it is a-doing, and when it is done. The
consciousness of having made this engagement would, if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were to make it, render such sense incomplete, and so open
the way to others. This is the real state of the case, and

<p>Mr. Dallas, who is a candidate for the Scotch professional
chair left vacant by Aytoun's death, has asked me
if I would object to introduce to you the first volume of a
book he has in the press with my publishers, on "The Gay
Science of Art and Criticism." I have replied I would <i>not</i>
object, as I have read as many of the sheets as I could get,
with extreme pleasure, and as I know you will find it a very
winning and brilliant piece of writing. Therefore he will
send the proofs of the volume to you as soon as he can get
them from the printer (at about the end of this week I take
it), and if you read them you will not be hard upon me for
bearing the responsibility of his doing so, I feel assured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>I suppose Mr. Dallas to have some impression that his
pleasing you with his book might advance his Scottish suit.
But all I know is, that he is a gentleman of great attainments
and erudition, much distinguished as the writer of
the best critical literary pieces in <i>The Times</i>, and thoroughly
versed in the subjects which Professor Aytoun represented
officially.</p>

down to the railway a day or two since to welcome me home

<p>Your hint that you were getting on with your story and

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>Having achieved my book and my Christmas
number, and having shaken myself after two years' work,
I send you my annual greeting. How are you? Asthmatic,
I know you will reply; but as my poor father (who was
asthmatic, too, and the jolliest of men) used philosophically
to say, "one must have something wrong, I suppose, and I
like to know what it is."</p>

<p>In England we are groaning under the brigandage of the
butcher, which is being carried to that height that I think
I foresee resistance on the part of the middle-class, and
some combination in perspective for abolishing the middleman,
whensoever he turns up (which is everywhere) between
producer and consumer. The cattle plague is the butcher's
stalking-horse, and it is unquestionably worse than it was;
but seeing that the great majority of creatures lost or
destroyed have been cows, and likewise that the rise in
butchers' meat bears no reasonable proportion to the
market prices of the beasts, one comes to the conclusion
that the public is done. The commission has ended very
weakly and ineffectually, as such things in England rather
frequently do; and everybody writes to <i>The Times</i>, and
nobody does anything else.</p>

<p>If the Americans don't embroil us in a war before long
it will not be their fault. What with their swagger and
bombast, what with their claims for indemnification, what
with Ireland and Fenianism, and what with Canada, I have
strong apprehensions. With a settled animosity towards
the French usurper, I believe him to have always been
sound in his desire to divide the States against themselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and that we were unsound and wrong in "letting I dare
not wait upon I would." The Jamaica insurrection is
another hopeful piece of business. That platform-sympathy
with the black&mdash;or the native, or the devil&mdash;afar off, and
that platform indifference to our own countrymen at enormous
odds in the midst of bloodshed and savagery, makes
me stark wild. Only the other day, here was a meeting of
jawbones of asses at Manchester, to censure the Jamaica
Governor for his manner of putting down the insurrection!
So we are badgered about New Zealanders and Hottentots,
as if they were identical with men in clean shirts at Camberwell,
and were to be bound by pen and ink accordingly.
So Exeter Hall holds us in mortal submission to missionaries,
who (Livingstone always excepted) are perfect nuisances,
and leave every place worse than they found it.</p>

<p>Of all the many evidences that are visible of our being
ill-governed, no one is so remarkable to me as our ignorance
of what is going on under our Government. What will
future generations think of that enormous Indian Mutiny
being ripened without suspicion, until whole regiments arose
and killed their officers? A week ago, red tape, half-bouncing
and half pooh-poohing what it bounced at, would
have scouted the idea of a Dublin jail not being able to
hold a political prisoner. But for the blacks in Jamaica
being over-impatient and before their time, the whites
might have been exterminated, without a previous hint or
suspicion that there was anything amiss. <i>Laissez aller</i>, and
Britons never, never, never!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Meantime, if your honour were in London, you would
see a great embankment rising high and dry out of the
Thames on the Middlesex shore, from Westminster Bridge
to Blackfriars. A really fine work, and really getting on.
Moreover, a great system of drainage. Another really fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
work, and likewise really getting on. Lastly, a muddle of
railways in all directions possible and impossible, with
no general public scheme, no general public supervision,
enormous waste of money, no fixable responsibility, no accountability
but under Lord Campbell's Act. I think of
that accident in which I was preserved. Before the most
furious and notable train in the four-and-twenty hours, the
head of a gang of workmen takes up the rails. That train
changes its time every day as the tide changes, and that
head workman is not provided by the railway company with
any clock or watch! Lord Shaftesbury wrote to me to ask
me what I thought of an obligation on railway companies to
put strong walls to all bridges and viaducts. I told him, of
course, that the force of such a shock would carry away anything
that any company could set up, and I added: "Ask
the minister what <i>he</i> thinks about the votes of the railway
interest in the House of Commons, and about his being afraid
to lay a finger on it with an eye to his majority."</p>

<p>I seem to be grumbling, but I am in the best of humours.
All goes well with me and mine, thank God.</p>

<p>Last night my gardener came upon a man in the garden
and fired. The man returned the compliment by kicking
him in the groin and causing him great pain. I set off, with
a great mastiff-bloodhound I have, in pursuit. Couldn't find
the evil-doer, but had the greatest difficulty in preventing
the dog from tearing two policemen down. They were
coming towards us with professional mystery, and he was
in the air on his way to the throat of an eminently respectable
constable when I caught him.</p>

<p>My daughter Mary and her aunt Georgina send kindest
regard and remembrance. Katey and her husband are
going to try London this winter, but I rather doubt (for
they are both delicate) their being able to weather it out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
It has been blowing here tremendously for a fortnight, but
to-day is like a spring day, and plenty of roses are growing
over the labourers' cottages. The <i>Great Eastern</i> lies at her
moorings beyond the window where I write these words;
looks very dull and unpromising. A dark column of smoke
from Chatham Dockyard, where the iron shipbuilding is in
progress, has a greater significance in it, I fancy.</p>

<p>As you want to know my views of the Sphinx, here
they are. But I have only seen it once; and it is so extraordinarily
well done, that it ought to be observed closely
several times.</p>

<p>Anyone who attentively notices the flower trick will see
that the two little high tables hung with drapery cover each
a trap. Each of those tables, during that trick, hides a
confederate, who changes the paper cone twice. When the
cone has been changed as often as is required, the trap is
closed and the table can be moved.</p>

<p>When the curtain is removed for the performance of the
Sphinx trick, there is a covered, that is, draped table on the
stage, which is never seen before or afterwards. In front of
the middle of it, and between it and the audience, stands one
of those little draped tables covering a trap; this is a third
trap in the centre of the stage. The box for the head is
then upon <span class="smcap">it</span>, and the conjuror takes it off and shows it.
The man whose head is afterwards shown in that box is, I
conceive, in the table; that is to say, is lying on his chest in
the thickness of the table, in an extremely constrained attitude.
To get him into the table, and to enable him to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the trap in the table through which his head comes into the
box, the two hands of a confederate are necessary. That
confederate comes up a trap, and stands in the space
afforded by the interval below the stage and the height of the
little draped table! his back is towards the audience. The
moment he has assisted the hidden man sufficiently, he closes
the trap, and the conjuror then immediately removes the
little draped table, and also the drapery of the larger table;
when he places the box on the last-named table <i>with the slide
on</i> for the head to come into it, he stands with his back to
the audience and his face to the box, and masks the box considerably
to facilitate the insertion of the head. As soon as
he knows the head to be in its place, he undraws the slide.
When the verses have been spoken and the trick is done, he
loses no time in replacing the slide. The curtain is then
immediately dropped, because the man cannot otherwise be
got out of the table, and has no doubt had quite enough of
it. With kindest regards to all at Penton,</p>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> furnished house hired by Charles Dickens in the spring
of this year was in Southwick Place, Hyde Park.</div>

<p>Having entered into negotiations with the Messrs.
Chappell for a series of readings to be given in London,
in the English provinces, in Scotland and Ireland, Charles
Dickens had no leisure for more than his usual editorial
work for "All the Year Round." He contributed four
parts to the Christmas number, which was entitled,
"Mugby Junction."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>For the future all his English readings were given in
connection with the Messrs. Chappell, and never in all his
career had he more satisfactory or more pleasant business
relations than those connected with these gentlemen.
Moreover, out of this connection sprang a sincere friendship
on both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. Dolby is so constantly mentioned in future letters,
that they themselves will tell of the cordial companionship
which existed between Charles Dickens and this able and
most obliging "manager."</p>

<p>The letter to "Lily" was in answer to a child's letter
from Miss Lily Benzon, inviting him to a birthday party.</p>

<p>The play alluded to in the letter to M. Fechter was
called "A Long Strike," and was performed at the Lyceum
Theatre.</p>

<p>The "Sultan" mentioned in the letter to Mr. Fitzgerald
was a noble Irish bloodhound, presented by this gentleman
to Charles Dickens. The story of the dog's death is told in
a letter to M. de Cerjat, which we give in the following
year.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mary</span>,</div>

<p>Feeling pretty certain that I shall never answer your
letter unless I answer it at once (I got it this morning),
here goes!</p>

<p>I did not dramatise "The Master of Ravenswood,"
though I did a good deal towards and about the piece,
having an earnest desire to put Scott, for once, upon the
stage in his own gallant manner. It is <i>an enormous success</i>,
and increases in attraction nightly. I have never seen the
people in all parts of the house so leaning forward, in lines
sloping towards the stage, earnestly and intently attractive,
as while the story gradually unfolds itself. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
astonishing circumstance of all is, that Miss Leclercq (never
thought of for Lucy till all other Lucies had failed) is
marvellously good, highly pathetic, and almost unrecognisable
in person! What note it touches in her, always dumb
until now, I do not pretend to say, but there is no one on
the stage who could play the contract scene better, or more
simply and naturally, and I find it impossible to see it
without crying! Almost everyone plays well, the whole is
exceedingly picturesque, and there is scarcely a movement
throughout, or a look, that is not indicated by Scott. So
you get a life romance with beautiful illustrations, and I do
not expect ever again to see a book take up its bed and
walk in like manner.</p>

<p>I am charmed to learn that you have had a freeze out
of my ghost story. It rather did give me a shiver up the
back in the writing. "Dr. Marigold" has just now accomplished
his two hundred thousand. My only other news
about myself is that I am doubtful whether to read or not
in London this season. If I decide to do it at all, I shall
probably do it on a large scale.</p>

<p>Many happy years to you, my dear Mary. So prays</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how grieved we all are here to
know that you are suffering again. Your patient tone,
however, and the hopefulness and forbearance of Ferguson's
course, gives us some reassurance. Apropos of which latter
reference I dined with Ferguson at the Lord Mayor's, last
Tuesday, and had a grimly distracted impulse upon me to
defy the toast-master and rush into a speech about him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
his noble art, when I sat pining under the imbecility of
constitutional and corporational idiots. I did seize him for a
moment by the hair of his head (in proposing the Lady
Mayoress), and derived some faint consolation from the
company's response to the reference. O! no man will ever
know under what provocation to contradiction and a savage
yell of repudiation I suffered at the hands of &mdash;&mdash;, feebly
complacent in the uniform of Madame Tussaud's own
military waxers, and almost the worst speaker I ever heard
in my life! Mary and Georgina, sitting on either side of
me, urged me to "look pleasant." I replied in expressions
not to be repeated. Shea (the judge) was just as good and
graceful, as he (the member) was bad and gawky.</p>

<p>Bulwer's "Lost Tales of Miletus" is a most noble book!
He is an extraordinary fellow, and fills me with admiration
and wonder.</p>

<p>It is of no use writing to you about yourself, my dear
Kent, because you are likely to be tired of that constant
companion, and so I have gone scratching (with an exceedingly
bad pen) about and about you. But I come back to
you to let you know that the reputation of this house as a
convalescent hospital stands (like the house itself) very
high, and that testimonials can be produced from credible
persons who have recovered health and spirits here swiftly.
Try us, only try us, and we are content to stake the reputation

<p>I found your letter here when I came back on
Wednesday evening, and was extremely glad to get it.</p>

<p>Frank Beard wrote me word that with such a pulse as
I described, an examination of the heart was absolutely
necessary, and that I had better make an appointment with
him alone for the purpose. This I did. I was not at all
disconcerted, for I knew well beforehand that the effect
could not possibly be without that one cause at the bottom
of it. There seems to be degeneration of some functions of
the heart. It does not contract as it should. So I have
got a prescription of iron, quinine, and digitalis, to set it
a-going, and send the blood more quickly through the
system. If it should not seem to succeed on a reasonable
trial, I will then propose a consultation with someone else.
Of course I am not so foolish as to suppose that all my
work can have been achieved without <i>some</i> penalty, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>

<i>Tuesday, Feb. 20th, 1866.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Brookfield</span>,</div>

<p>Having gone through your MS. (which I should have
done sooner, but that I have not been very well), I write
these few following words about it. Firstly, with a limited
reference to its unsuitability to these pages. Secondly, with
a more enlarged reference to the merits of the story itself.</p>

<p>If you will take any part of it and cut it up (in fancy)
into the small portions into which it would have to be
divided here for only a month's supply, you will (I think) at
once discover the impossibility of publishing it in weekly
parts. The scheme of the chapters, the manner of introducing
the people, the progress of the interest, the places
in which the principal places fall, are all hopelessly against
it. It would seem as though the story were never coming,
and hardly ever moving. There must be a special design
to overcome that specially trying mode of publication, and I
cannot better express the difficulty and labour of it than by
asking you to turn over any two weekly numbers of "A
Tale of Two Cities," or "Great Expectations," or Bulwer's
story, or Wilkie Collins's, or Reade's, or "At the Bar,"
and notice how patiently and expressly the thing has to be
planned for presentation in these fragments, and yet for
afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the story itself I honestly say that I think highly.
The style is particularly easy and agreeable, infinitely above
ordinary writing, and sometimes reminds me of Mrs. Inchbald
at her best. The characters are remarkably well
observed, and with a rare mixture of delicacy and truthfulness.
I observe this particularly in the brother and sister,
and in Mrs. Neville. But it strikes me that you constantly
hurry your narrative (and yet without getting on) <i>by telling
it, in a sort of impetuous breathless way, in your own person,
when the people should tell it and act it for themselves</i>. My
notion always is, that when I have made the people to play
out the play, it is, as it were, their business to do it, and not
mine. Then, unless you really have led up to a great situation
like Basil's death, you are bound in art to make more
of it. Such a scene should form a chapter of itself.
Impressed upon the reader's memory, it would go far to
make the fortune of the book. Suppose yourself telling
that affecting incident in a letter to a friend. Wouldn't
you describe how you went through the life and stir of the
streets and roads to the sick-room? Wouldn't you say
what kind of room it was, what time of day it was, whether
it was sunlight, starlight, or moonlight? Wouldn't you
have a strong impression on your mind of how you were
received, when you first met the look of the dying man,
what strange contrasts were about you and struck you? I
don't want you, in a novel, to present <i>yourself</i> to tell such
things, but I want the things to be there. You make no
more of the situation than the index might, or a descriptive
playbill might in giving a summary of the tragedy under
representation.</p>

<p>As a mere piece of mechanical workmanship, I think all
your chapters should be shorter; that is to say, that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>should be subdivided. Also, when you change from narrative
to dialogue, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, you should make the transition
more carefully. Also, taking the pains to sit down and
recall the principal landmarks in your story, you should then
make them far more elaborate and conspicuous than the
rest. Even with these changes I do not believe that the
story would attract the attention due to it, if it were published
even in such monthly portions as the space of
"Fraser" would admit of. Even so brightened, it would
not, to the best of my judgment, express itself piecemeal.
It seems to me to be so constituted as to require to be read
"off the reel." As a book in two volumes I think it would
have good claims to success, and good chances of obtaining
success. But I suppose the polishing I have hinted at
(not a meretricious adornment, but positively necessary to
good work and good art) to have been first thoroughly
administered.</p>

<p>Now don't hate me if you can help it. I can afford to
be hated by some people, but I am not rich enough to put
you in possession of that luxury.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Ever faithfully yours.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The MS. shall be delivered at your house to-morrow.
And your petitioner again prays not to be, etc.</p>

<p>The reception at Manchester last night was quite a
magnificent sight; the whole of the immense audience
standing up and cheering. I thought them a little slow
with "Marigold," but believe it was only the attention
necessary in so vast a place. They gave a splendid burst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at the end. And after "Nickleby" (which went to perfection),
they set up such a call, that I was obliged to
go in again. The unfortunate gasman, a very steady
fellow, got a fall off a ladder and sprained his leg. He
was put to bed in a public opposite, and was left there,
poor man.</p>

<p>This is the first very fine day we have had. I have taken
advantage of it by crossing to Birkenhead and getting some
air upon the water. It was fresh and beautiful.</p>

<p>I send my best love to Mamie, and hope she is better. I
am, of course, tired (the pull of "Marigold" upon one's
energy, in the Free Trade Hall, was great); but I stick to
my tonic, and feel, all things considered, in very good tone.

<p>The police reported officially that three thousand
people were turned away from the hall last night. I doubt
if they were so numerous as that, but they carried in the
outer doors and pitched into Dolby with great vigour. I
need not add that every corner of the place was crammed.
They were a very fine audience, and took enthusiastically
every point in "Copperfield" and the "Trial." They made
the reading a quarter of an hour longer than usual. One man
advertised in the morning paper that he would give thirty
shillings (double) for three stalls, but nobody would sell,
and he didn't get in.</p>

<p>Except that I cannot sleep, I really think myself in
much better training than I had anticipated. A dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
oysters and a little champagne between the parts every
night, constitute the best restorative I have ever yet tried.
John appears low, but I don't know why. A letter comes
for him daily; the hand is female; whether Smudger's, or
a nearer one still and a dearer one, I don't know. So it
may or may not be the cause of his gloom.</p>

<p>We arrived here at ten yesterday evening. I don't

cold collation and "the best of drinks," and we dined in

<p>The let here is very large. Every precaution taken to
prevent my platform from being captured as it was last
time; but I don't feel at all sure that it will not be stormed
at one of the two readings. Wills is to do the genteel
to-night at the stalls, and Dolby is to stem the shilling tide
<i>if</i> he can. The poor gasman cannot come on, and we
have got a new one here who is to go to Edinburgh with
us. Of Edinburgh we know nothing, but as its first
night has always been shady, I suppose it will stick to its
antecedents.</p>

<p>I like to hear about Harness and his freshness. The
let for the next reading at St. James's is "going," they
report, "admirably." Lady Russell asked me to dinner
to-morrow, and I have written her a note to-day. The rest
has certainly done me good. I slept thoroughly well last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

<p>We had a tremendous house again last night at Glasgow;
and turned away great numbers. Not only that, but they
were a most brilliant and delicate audience, and took
"Marigold" with a fine sense and quickness not to be surpassed.
The shillings pitched into Dolby again, and one
man writes a sensible letter in one of the papers this morning,
showing to <i>my</i> satisfaction (?) that they really had,
through the local agent, some cause of complaint. Nevertheless,
the shilling tickets are sold for to-morrow, and it
seems to be out of the question to take any money at the
doors, the call for all parts is so enormous. The thundering
of applause last night was quite staggering, and my people
checked off my reception by the minute hand of a watch,
and stared at one another, thinking I should never begin. I
keep quite well, have happily taken to sleeping these last
three nights; and feel, all things considered, very little
conscious of fatigue. I cannot reconcile my town medicine
with the hours and journeys of reading life, and have therefore
given it up for the time. But for the moment, I think
I am better without it. What we are doing here I have not
yet heard. I write at half-past one, and we have been little
more than an hour in the house. But I am quite prepared

<p>The house was more than twice better than any first
night here previously. They were, as usual here, remarkably
intelligent, and the reading went <i>brilliantly</i>. I have
not sent up any newspapers, as they are generally so poorly
written, that you may know beforehand all the commonplaces
that they will write. But <i>The Scotsman</i> has so
pretty an article this morning, and (so far as I know) so
true a one, that I will try to post it to you, either from here
or Glasgow. John and Dolby went over early, and Wills
and I follow them at half-past eleven. It is cold and wet
here. We have laid half-crown bets with Dolby, that he
will be assaulted to-night at Glasgow. He has a surprising
knowledge of what the receipts will be always, and wins
half-crowns every night. Chang is living in this house.
John (not knowing it) was rendered perfectly drivelling

<p>No row at Glasgow last night. Great placards were
posted about the town by the anxious Dolby, announcing
that no money would be taken at the doors. This kept the
crowd off. Two files of policemen and a double staff everywhere
did the rest, and nothing could be better-tempered or
more orderly. Tremendous enthusiasm with the "Carol"
and "Trial." I was dead beat afterwards, that reading
being twenty minutes longer than usual; but plucked up
again, had some supper, slept well, and am quite right to-day.
It is a bright day, and the express ride over from
Glasgow was very pleasant.</p>

<p>Everything is gone here for to-night. But it is difficult
to describe what the readings have grown to be. The let
at St. James's Hall is not only immense for next Tuesday,
but so large for the next reading afterwards, that Chappell
writes: "That will be the greatest house of the three."
From Manchester this morning they write: "Send us more
tickets instantly, for we are sold out and don't know what
to do with the people." Last night the whole of my money
under the agreement had been taken. I notice that a great
bank has broken at Liverpool, which may hurt us there,
but when last heard of it was going as before. And the
audience, though so enormous, do somehow express a personal
affection, which makes them very strange and moving
to see.</p>

<p>I have a story to answer you and your aunt with. Before
I left Southwick Place for Liverpool, I received a letter
from Glasgow, saying, "Your little Emily has been woo'd
and married and a'! since you last saw her;" and describing
her house within a mile or two of the city, and asking me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to stay there. I wrote the usual refusal, and supposed
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; to be some romantic girl whom I had joked
with, perhaps at Allison's or where not. On the first night
at Glasgow I received a bouquet from &mdash;&mdash;, and wore
one of the flowers. This morning at the Glasgow station,
&mdash;&mdash; appeared, and proved to be the identical Miss Emily,
of whose marriage Dolby had told me on our coming through
Preston. She was attired in magnificent raiment, and
presented the happy &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>We noticed between London and Rugby (the first
stoppage) something very odd in our carriage yesterday,
not so much in its motion as in its sound. We examined it
as well as we could out of both windows, but could make
nothing of it. On our arrival at Rugby, it was found to be
on fire. And as it was in the middle of the train, the train
had to be broken to get it off into a siding by itself and
get another carriage on. With this slight exception we
came down all right.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fechter</span>,</div>

<p>This morning I received the play to the end of the
telegraph scene, and I have since read it twice.</p>

<p>I clearly see the <i>ground</i> of Mr. Boucicault's two objections;
but I do not see their <i>force</i>.</p>

<p>First, as to the writing. If the characters did not
speak in a terse and homely way, their idea and language
would be inconsistent with their dress and station, and
they would lose, as characters, before the audience. The
dialogue seems to be exactly what is wanted. Its simplicity
(particularly in Mr. Boucicault's part) is often very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
effective; and throughout there is an honest, straight-to-the-purpose
ruggedness in it, like the real life and the
real people.</p>

<p>Secondly, as to the absence of the comic element. I
really do not see how more of it could be got into the story,
and I think Mr. Boucicault underrates the pleasant effect of
his own part. The very notion of a sailor, whose life is not
among those little courts and streets, and whose business
does not lie with the monotonous machinery, but with the
four wild winds, is a relief to me in reading the play. I
am quite confident of its being an immense relief to the
audience when they see the sailor before them, with an
entirely different bearing, action, dress, complexion even,
from the rest of the men. I would make him the freshest
and airiest sailor that ever was seen; and through him I can
distinctly see my way out of "the Black Country" into
clearer air. (I speak as one of the audience, mind.) I
should like something of this contrast to be expressed in
the dialogue between the sailor and Jew, in the second
scene of the second act. Again, I feel Widdicomb's part
(which is charming, and ought to make the whole house cry)
most agreeable and welcome, much better than any amount
in such a story, of mere comicality.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that the play is done with a master's
hand. Its closeness and movement are quite surprising.
Its construction is admirable. I have the strongest belief
in its making a great success. But I must add this proviso:
I never saw a play so dangerously depending in critical
places on strict natural propriety in the manner and perfection
in the shaping of the small parts. Those small
parts cannot take the play up, but they can let it down. I
would not leave a hair on the head of one of them to the
chance of the first night, but I would see, to the minutest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
particular, the make-up of every one of them at a night
rehearsal.</p>

<p>Of course you are free to show this note to Mr. Boucicault,
and I suppose you will do so; let me throw out this suggestion
to him and you. Might it not ease the way with
the Lord Chamberlain's office, and still more with the
audience, when there are Manchester champions in it, if
instead of "Manchester" you used a fictitious name?
When I did "Hard Times" I called the scene Coketown.
Everybody knew what was meant, but every cotton-spinning
town said it was the other cotton-spinning town.</p>

<p>I shall be up on Saturday, and will come over about
mid-day, unless you name any other time.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Thornbury</span>,</div>

<p>Many thanks for your letter.</p>

<p>In reference to your Shakespeare queries, I am not so
much enamoured of the first and third subjects as I am of
the Ariosto enquiry, which should be highly interesting.
But if you have so got the matter in your mind, as that its
execution would be incomplete and unsatisfactory to you
unless you write all the three papers, then by all means
write the three, and I will most gladly take them. For
some years I have had so much pleasure in reading you,
that I can honestly warrant myself as what actors call "a
good audience."</p>

<p>The idea of old stories retold is decidedly a good one.
I greatly like the notion of that series. Of course you know
De Quincey's paper on the Ratcliffe Highway murderer?
Do you know also the illustration (I have it at Gad's Hill),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
representing the horrible creature as his dead body lay on a
cart, with a piece of wood for a pillow, and a stake lying
by, ready to be driven through him?</p>

<p>I don't <i>quite</i> like the title, "The Social History of
London." I should better like some title to the effect,
"The History of London's Social Changes in so many
Years." Such a title would promise more, and better
express your intention. What do you think of taking for a
first title, "London's Changes"? You could then add the
second title, "Being a History," etc.</p>

<p>I don't at all desire to fix a limit to the series of old
stories retold. I would state the general intention at the
beginning of the first paper, and go on like Banquo's
line.</p>

<p>Don't let your London title remind people, by so much
as the place of the word "civilisation," of Buckle. It seems
a ridiculous caution, but the indolent part of the public
(a large part!) on such points tumble into extraordinary
mistakes.</p>

<p>It is always pleasant to me to hear from you, and I
hope you will believe that this is not a mere fashion of
speech.</p>

<p>Concerning the green covers, I find the leaves to be
budding&mdash;on unquestionable newspaper authority; but,
upon my soul, I have no other knowledge of their being
in embryo! Really, I do not see a chance of my settling
myself to such work until after I have accomplished forty-two
readings, to which I stand pledged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope to begin this series somewhere about the middle
of January, in Dublin. Touching the details of the realisation
of this hope, will you tell me in a line as soon as you can&mdash;<i>Is
the exhibition room a good room for speaking in?</i></p>

<p>Your mention of the late Sultan touches me nearly.
He was the finest dog I ever saw, and between him and
me there was a perfect understanding. But, to adopt the
popular phrase, it was so very confidential that it "went no
further." He would fly at anybody else with the greatest
enthusiasm for destruction. I saw him, muzzled, pound
into the heart of a regiment of the line; and I have
frequently seen him, muzzled, hold a great dog down with
his chest and feet. He has broken loose (muzzled) and
come home covered with blood, again and again. And yet
he never disobeyed me, unless he had first laid hold of
a dog.</p>

<p>You heard of his going to execution, evidently supposing
the procession to be a party detached in pursuit of something
to kill or eat? It was very affecting. And also
of his bolting a blue-eyed kitten, and making me acquainted
with the circumstance by his agonies of remorse
(or indigestion)?</p>

<p>I cannot find out that there is anyone in Rochester (a
sleepy old city) who has anything to tell about Garrick,
except what is not true. His brother, the wine merchant,
would be more in Rochester way, I think. How on earth
do you find time to do all these books?</p>

<p>You make my hair stand on end; an agreeable sensation,
for I am charmed to find that I have any. Why don't you
come yourself and look after Garrick? I should be truly
delighted to receive you.</p>

<p>I have received your letter with the utmost pleasure
and we all send our most affectionate love to you, Mrs.

Christmas and New Year greetings are to be understood as
included.</p>

<p>You will be interested in knowing that, encouraged by
the success of summer cricket-matches, I got up a quantity
of foot-races and rustic sports in my field here on the 26th
last past: as I have never yet had a case of drunkenness, the
landlord of The Falstaff had a drinking-booth on the ground.
All the prizes I gave were in money, too. We had two
thousand people here. Among the crowd were soldiers,
navvies, and labourers of all kinds. Not a stake was pulled
up, or a rope slackened, or one farthing's-worth of damage
done. To every competitor (only) a printed bill of general
rules was given, with the concluding words: "Mr. Dickens
puts every man upon his honour to assist in preserving
order." There was not a dispute all day, and they went
away at sunset rending the air with cheers, and leaving
every flag on a six hundred yards' course as neat as they
found it when the gates were opened at ten in the morning.
Surely this is a bright sign in the neighbourhood of such a
place as Chatham!</p>

<p>"Mugby Junction" turned, yesterday afternoon, the
extraordinary number of two hundred and fifty thousand!</p>

<p>In the middle of next month I begin a new course of
forty-two readings. If any of them bring me within reach
of Cheltenham, with an hour to spare, I shall come on to
you, even for that hour. More of this when I am afield and
have my list, which Dolby (for Chappell) is now preparing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Forster and Mrs. Forster were to have come to us next
Monday, to stay until Saturday. I write "were," because
I hear that Forster (who had a touch of bronchitis when he
wrote to me on Christmas Eve) is in bed. Katie, who has
been ill of low nervous fever, was brought here yesterday
from London. She bore the journey much better than I
expected, and so I hope will soon recover. This is my little
stock of news.</p>

<p>I begin to discover in your riper years, that you have
been secretly vain of your handwriting all your life. For
I swear I see no change in it! What it always was since I
first knew it (a year or two!) it <i>is</i>. This I will maintain
against all comers.</p>

<h2>1867.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>As</span> the London and provincial readings were to be resumed
early in the year and continued until the end of March,
Charles Dickens took no house in London this spring. He
came to his office quarters at intervals, for the series in town;
usually starting off again, on his country tour, the day after
a London reading. From some passages in his letters to his
daughter and sister-in-law during this country course, it
will be seen that (though he made very light of the fact)
the great exertion of the readings, combined with incessant
railway travelling, was beginning to tell upon his health,
and he was frequently "heavily beaten" after reading at
his best to an enthusiastic audience in a large hall.</div>

<p>During the short intervals between his journeys, he was
as constantly and carefully at work upon the business of
"All the Year Round" as if he had no other work on hand.
A proof of this is given in a letter dated "5th February."
It is written to a young man (the son of a friend), who wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a long novel when far too juvenile for such a task, and had
submitted it to Charles Dickens for his opinion, with a view
to publication. In the midst of his own hard and engrossing
occupation he read the book, and the letter which he wrote
on the subject needs no remark beyond this, that the young
writer received the adverse criticism with the best possible
sense, and has since, in his literary profession, profited by
the advice so kindly given.</p>

<p>At this time the proposals to Charles Dickens for reading
in America, which had been perpetually renewed from the
time of his first abandoning the idea, became so urgent
and so tempting, that he found at last he must, at all events,
give the subject his most serious consideration. He took
counsel with his two most confidential friends and advisers,
Mr. John Forster and Mr. W. H. Wills. They were both,
at first, strongly opposed to the undertaking, chiefly on the
ground of the trial to his health and strength which it would
involve. But they could not deny the counterbalancing
advantages. And, after much deliberation, it was resolved
that Mr. George Dolby should be sent out by the Messrs.
Chappell, to take an impression, on the spot, as to the feeling
of the United States about the Readings. His report as to
the undoubted enthusiasm and urgency on the other side of
the Atlantic it was impossible to resist. Even his friends
withdrew their opposition (though still with misgivings as
to the effect upon his health, which were but too well
founded!), and on the 30th September he telegraphed
"Yes" to America.</p>

<p>The "Alfred" alluded to in a letter from Glasgow
was Charles Dickens's fourth son, Alfred Tennyson, who
had gone to Australia two years previously.</p>

<p>We give, in April, the last letter to one of the friends
for whom Charles Dickens had always a most tender love&mdash;Mr.
Stanfield. He was then in failing health, and in May
he died.</p>

<p>Another death which affected him very deeply happened
this summer. Miss Marguerite Power died in July. She
had long been very ill, but, until it became impossible for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
her to travel, she was a frequent and beloved guest at Gad's
Hill. The Mrs. Henderson to whom he writes was Miss
Power's youngest sister.</p>

<p>Before he started for America it was proposed to wish
him God-speed by giving him a public dinner at the
Freemasons' Hall. The proposal was most warmly and
fully responded to. His zealous friend, Mr. Charles Kent,
willingly undertook the whole work of arrangement of this
banquet. It took place on the 2nd November, and Lord
Lytton presided.</p>

<p>On the 8th he left London for Liverpool, accompanied
by his daughters, his sister-in-law, his eldest son, Mr.
Arthur Chappell, Mr. Charles Collins, Mr. Wilkie Collins,
Mr. Kent, and Mr. Wills. The next morning the whole
party took a final leave of Charles Dickens on board the
<i>Cuba</i>, which sailed that day.</p>

<p>We give a letter which he wrote to Mr. J. L. Toole on
the morning of the dinner, thanking him for a parting gift
and an earnest letter. That excellent comedian was one of
his most appreciative admirers, and, in return, he had for
Mr. Toole the greatest admiration and respect.</p>

<p>The Christmas number for this year, "No Thoroughfare,"
was written by Charles Dickens and Mr. Wilkie
Collins. It was dramatised by Mr. Collins chiefly. But, in
the midst of all the work of preparation for departure,
Charles Dickens gave minute attention to as much of the
play as could be completed before he left England. It was
produced, after Christmas, at the Adelphi Theatre, where
M. Fechter was then acting, under the management of
Mr. Benjamin Webster.</p>

<p>Thoroughly determined to be beforehand with "the
middle of next summer," your penitent friend and remorseful
correspondent thus addresses you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The big dog, on a day last autumn, having seized a little
girl (sister to one of the servants) whom he knew, and was
bound to respect, was flogged by his master, and then sentenced
to be shot at seven next morning. He went out
very cheerfully with the half-dozen men told off for the purpose,
evidently thinking that they were going to be the
death of somebody unknown. But observing in the procession
an empty wheelbarrow and a double-barrelled gun,
he became meditative, and fixed the bearer of the gun with
his eyes. A stone deftly thrown across him by the village
blackguard (chief mourner) caused him to look round for
an instant, and he then fell dead, shot through the heart.
Two posthumous children are at this moment rolling on the
lawn; one will evidently inherit his ferocity, and will probably
inherit the gun. The pheasant was a little ailing
towards Christmas Day, and was found dead under some
ivy in his cage, with his head under his wing, on the morning
of the twenty-seventh of December, one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-six. I, proprietor of the remains of the
two deceased, am working hard, getting up "Barbox" and
"The Boy at Mugby," with which I begin a new series of
readings in London on the fifteenth. Next morning I believe
I start into the country. When I read, I <i>don't</i> write. I
only edit, and have the proof-sheets sent me for the purpose.
Here are your questions answered.</p>

<p>As to the Reform question, it should have been, and
could have been, perfectly known to any honest man in
England that the more intelligent part of the great masses
were deeply dissatisfied with the state of representation, but
were in a very moderate and patient condition, awaiting the
better intellectual cultivation of numbers of their fellows.
The old insolent resource of assailing them and making the
most audaciously wicked statements that they are politically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
indifferent, has borne the inevitable fruit. The perpetual
taunt, "Where are they?" has called them out with the
answer: "Well then, if you <i>must</i> know, here we are."
The intolerable injustice of vituperating the bribed to an
assembly of bribers, has goaded their sense of justice
beyond endurance. And now, what they would have taken
they won't take, and whatever they are steadily bent upon
having they will get. Rely upon it, this is the real state of
the case. As to your friend "Punch," you will find him begin
to turn at the very selfsame instant when the new game
shall manifestly become the losing one. You may notice his
shoes pinching him a little already.</p>

<p>My dear fellow, I have no more power to stop that
mutilation of my books than you have. It is as certain as
that every inventor of anything designed for the public
good, and offered to the English Government, becomes <i>ipso
facto</i> a criminal, to have his heart broken on the circumlocutional
wheel. It is as certain as that the whole Crimean
story will be retold, whenever this country again goes
to war. And to tell the truth, I have such a very small
opinion of what the great genteel have done for us, that I
am very philosophical indeed concerning what the great
vulgar may do, having a decided opinion that they can't do
worse.</p>

<p>This is the time of year when the theatres do best, there
being still numbers of people who make it a sort of religion
to see Christmas pantomimes. Having my annual
houseful, I have, as yet, seen nothing. Fechter has neither
pantomime nor burlesque, but is doing a new version of the
old "Trente Ans de la Vie d'un Joueur." I am afraid he
will not find his account in it. On the whole, the theatres,
except in the articles of scenery and pictorial effect, are
poor enough. But in some of the smaller houses there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
actors who, if there were any dramatic head-quarters as a
school, might become very good. The most hopeless
feature is, that they have the smallest possible idea of an
effective and harmonious whole, each "going in" for
himself or herself. The music-halls attract an immense
public, and don't refine the general taste. But such things
as they do are well done of their kind, and always briskly
and punctually.</p>

<p>The American yacht race is the last sensation. I hope
the general interest felt in it on this side will have a
wholesome interest on that. It will be a woeful day when
John and Jonathan throw their caps into the ring. The
French Emperor is indubitably in a dangerous state. His
Parisian popularity wanes, and his army are discontented
with him. I hear on high authority that his secret police
are always making discoveries that render him desperately
uneasy.</p>

<p>You know how we have been swindling in these parts.
But perhaps you don't know that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the "eminent"
contractor, before he fell into difficulties settled <i>one
million of money</i> on his wife. Such a good and devoted
husband!</p>

<p>My daughter Katie has been very ill of nervous fever.
On the 27th of December she was in a condition to be
brought down here (old high road and post-horses), and has
been steadily getting better ever since. Her husband is
here too, and is on the whole as well as he ever is or ever
will be, I fear.</p>

<p>We played forfeit-games here, last night, and then pool.
For a billiard-room has been added to the house since you
were here. Come and play a match with me.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>First I send you my most affectionate wishes for
many, many happy returns of your birthday. That done,
from my heart of hearts, I go on to my small report of
myself.</p>

<p>The readings have produced such an immense effect here
that we are coming back for two more in the middle of
February. "Marigold" and the "Trial," on Friday night,
and the "Carol," on Saturday afternoon, were a perfect
furore; and the surprise about "Barbox" has been amusingly
great. It is a most extraordinary thing, after the
enormous sale of that Christmas number, that the provincial
public seems to have combined to believe that it <i>won't</i>
make a reading. From Wolverhampton and Leeds we have
exactly the same expression of feelings <i>beforehand</i>. Exactly
as I made "Copperfield"&mdash;always to the poorest houses I
had with Headland, and against that luminary's entreaty&mdash;so
I should have to make this, if I hadn't "Marigold"
always in demand.</p>

<p>It being next to impossible for people to come out at
night with horses, we have felt the weather in the stalls,
and expect to do so through this week. The half-crown
and shilling publics have crushed to their places most
splendidly. The enthusiasm has been unbounded. On
Friday night I quite astonished myself; but I was taken so
faint afterwards that they laid me on a sofa at the hall for
half an hour. I attribute it to my distressing inability to
sleep at night, and to nothing worse.</p>

<p>Scott does very well indeed. As a dresser he is perfect.
In a quarter of an hour after I go into the retiring-room,
where all my clothes are airing and everything is set out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
neatly in its own allotted space, I am ready; and he then
goes softly out, and sits outside the door. In the morning
he is equally punctual, quiet, and quick. He has his
needles and thread, buttons, and so forth, always at hand;
and in travelling he is very systematic with the luggage.
What with Dolby and what with this skilful valet, everything
is made as easy to me as it possibly <i>can</i> be, and
Dolby would do anything to lighten the work, and does
everything.</p>

<p>There is great distress here among the poor (four
thousand people relieved last Saturday at one workhouse),
and there is great anxiety concerning <i>seven mail-steamers
some days overdue</i>. Such a circumstance as this last has
never been known. It is supposed that some great revolving
storm has whirled them all out of their course. One
of these missing ships is an American mail, another an
Australian mail.</p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Same Afternoon.</i><br />
</div>

<p>We have been out for four hours in the bitter east wind,
and walking on the sea-shore, where there is a broad strip
of great blocks of ice. My hands are so rigid that I write
with great difficulty.</p>

<p>We have been constantly talking of the terrible Regent's
Park accident. I hope and believe that nearly the worst of
it is now known.</p>

<p>We came over here from Liverpool at eleven this
forenoon. There was a heavy swell in the Mersey breaking
over the boat; the cold was nipping, and all the roads we
saw as we came along were wretched. We find a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
moderate let here; but I am myself rather surprised to
know that a hundred and twenty stalls have made up their
minds to the undertaking of getting to the hall. This seems
to be a very nice hotel, but it is an extraordinarily cold one.
Our reading for to-night is "Marigold" and "Trial." With
amazing perversity the local agent said to Dolby: "They
hoped that Mr. Dickens <i>might</i> have given them 'The Boy
at Mugby.'"</p>

<p>Barton, the gasman who succeeded the man who sprained
his leg, sprained <i>his</i> leg yesterday!! And that, not at his
work, but in running downstairs at the hotel. However, he
has hobbled through it so far, and I hope will hobble on, for
he knows his work.</p>

<p>I have seldom seen a place look more hopelessly frozen
up than this place does. The hall is like a Methodist chapel
in low spirits, and with a cold in its head. A few blue people
shiver at the corners of the streets. And this house, which
is outside the town, looks like an ornament on an immense
twelfth cake baked for 1847.</p>

<p>I am now going to the fire to try to warm myself, but
have not the least expectation of succeeding. The sitting-room
has two large windows in it, down to the ground and
facing due east. The adjoining bedroom (mine) has also
two large windows in it, down to the ground and facing due
east. The very large doors are opposite the large windows,
and I feel as if I were something to eat in a pantry.</p>

<p>At Chester we read in a snowstorm and a fall of ice. I
think it was the worst weather I ever saw. Nevertheless,
the people were enthusiastic. At Wolverhampton last night
the thaw had thoroughly set in, and it rained heavily. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
had not intended to go back there, but have arranged to do so
on the day after Ash Wednesday. Last night I was again
heavily beaten. We came on here after the reading (it is
only a ride of forty minutes), and it was as much as I could
do to hold out the journey. But I was not faint, as at
Liverpool; I was only exhausted. I am all right this
morning; and to-night, as you know, I have a rest. I
trust that Charley Collins is better, and that Mamie is
strong and well again. Yesterday I had a note from Katie,
which seemed hopeful and encouraging.</p>

<p>Since I wrote to your aunt just now, I have received
your note addressed to Wolverhampton. We left the men
there last night, and they brought it on with them at noon
to-day.</p>

<p>The maimed gasman's foot is much swollen, but he
limps about and does his work. I have doctored him up
with arnica. During the "Boy" last night there was an
escape of gas from the side of my top batten, which caught
the copper-wire and was within a thread of bringing down
the heavy reflector into the stalls. It was a very ticklish
matter, though the audience knew nothing about it. I saw
it, and the gasman and Dolby saw it, and stood at that side
of the platform in agonies. We all three calculated that
there would be just time to finish and save it; when the gas
was turned out the instant I had done, the whole thing was
at its very last and utmost extremity. Whom it would
have tumbled on, or what might have been set on fire, it is
impossible to say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

And I even have my doubts of the possibility of Dolby's
cramming the people in. For "Marigold" and "Trial"

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>I have looked at the larger half of the first volume
of your novel, and have pursued the more difficult points of
the story through the other two volumes.</p>

<p>You will, of course, receive my opinion as that of an
individual writer and student of art, who by no means claims
to be infallible.</p>

<p>I think you are too ambitious, and that you have not
sufficient knowledge of life or character to venture on so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>comprehensive an attempt. Evidences of inexperience in
every way, and of your power being far below the situations
that you imagine, present themselves to me in almost every
page I have read. It would greatly surprise me if you
found a publisher for this story, on trying your fortune in
that line, or derived anything from it but weariness and
bitterness of spirit.</p>

<p>On the evidence thus put before me, I cannot even
entirely satisfy myself that you have the faculty of authorship
latent within you. If you have not, and yet pursue a
vocation towards which you have no call, you cannot choose
but be a wretched man. Let me counsel you to have the
patience to form yourself carefully, and the courage to
renounce the endeavour if you cannot establish your case
on a very much smaller scale. You see around you every
day, how many outlets there are for short pieces of fiction
in all kinds. Try if you can achieve any success within
these modest limits (I have practised in my time what I
preach to you), and in the meantime put your three volumes
away.</p>

<p>My short report of myself is that we had an enormous
turn-away last night, and do not doubt about having a cram
to-night. The day has been very fine, and I have turned it
to the wholesomest account by walking on the sands at New
Brighton all the morning. I am not quite right, but believe
it to be an effect of the railway shaking. There is no doubt
of the fact that, after the Staplehurst experience, it tells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
more and more, instead of (as one might have expected) less
and less.</p>

<p>The charming room here greatly lessens the fatigue of
this fatiguing week. I read last night with no more exertion
than if I had been at Gad's, and yet to eleven hundred
people, and with astonishing effect. It is "Copperfield"
to-night, and Liverpool is the "Copperfield"
stronghold.</p>

<p>We arrived here this morning at our time to the moment,
five minutes past ten. We turned away great numbers on
both nights at Liverpool; and Manchester last night was a
splendid spectacle. They cheered to that extent after it was
over, that I was obliged to huddle on my clothes (for I was
undressing to prepare for the journey), and go back
again.</p>

<p>After so heavy a week, it <i>was</i> rather stiff to start on this
long journey at a quarter to two in the morning; but I got
more sleep than I ever got in a railway-carriage before, and
it really was not tedious. The travelling was admirable,
and a wonderful contrast to my friend the Midland.</p>

<p>I am not by any means knocked up, though I have, as I
had in the last series of readings, a curious feeling of soreness
all round the body, which I suppose to arise from the
great exertion of voice. It is a mercy that we were not both
made really ill at Liverpool. On Friday morning I was taken
so faint and sick, that I was obliged to leave the table. On
the same afternoon the same thing happened to Dolby. We
then found that a part of the hotel close to us was dismantled
for painting, and that they were at that moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
painting a green passage leading to our rooms, with a most
horrible mixture of white lead and arsenic. On pursuing
the enquiry, I found that the four lady book-keepers in the
bar were all suffering from the poison.</p>

I mention it, only in case you should come in his way, for I

<p>After two days' rest at the Bridge of Allan I am in
renewed force, and have nothing to complain of but inability
to sleep. I have been in excellent air all day since Tuesday
at noon, and made an interesting walk to Stirling yesterday,
and saw its lions, and (strange to relate) was not bored
by them. Indeed, they left me so fresh that I knocked at
the gate of the prison, presented myself to the governor,
and took Dolby over the jail, to his unspeakable interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
We then walked back again to our excellent country

<p>Enclosed is a letter from Alfred, which you and your

the sun shines here to-day! But to counterbalance
that phenomenon I am in close hiding from &mdash;&mdash;, who has
christened his infant son in my name, and, consequently,
haunts the building. He and Dolby have already nearly
come into collision, in consequence of the latter being
always under the dominion of the one idea that he is bound

<p>The readings have made an immense effect in this place,
and it is remarkable that although the people are individually
rough, collectively they are an unusually tender and
sympathetic audience; while their comic perception is quite
up to the high London standard. The atmosphere is so
very heavy that yesterday we escaped to Tynemouth for a
two hours' sea walk. There was a high north wind blowing
and a magnificent sea running. Large vessels were being
towed in and out over the stormy bar, with prodigious
waves breaking on it; and spanning the restless uproar of
the waters was a quiet rainbow of transcendent beauty.
The scene was quite wonderful. We were in the full enjoyment
of it when a heavy sea caught us, knocked us over,
and in a moment drenched us, and filled even our pockets.
We had nothing for it but to shake ourselves together (like
Doctor Marigold) and dry ourselves as well as we could by
hard walking in the wind and sunshine! But we were wet
through for all that when we came back here to dinner
after half an hour's railway ride.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>We made our journey through an incessant snowstorm
on Wednesday night; at last got snowed up among the
Welsh mountains in a tremendous storm of wind, came to
a stop, and had to dig the engine out. We went to bed at
Holyhead at six in the morning of Thursday, and got aboard
the packet at two yesterday afternoon. It blew hard, but
as the wind was right astern, we only rolled and did not
pitch much. As I walked about on the bridge all the four
hours, and had cold salt beef and biscuit there and brandy-and-water,
you will infer that my Channel training has not
worn out.</p>

<p>Our "business" here is <i>very bad</i>, though at Belfast it is
enormous. There is no doubt that great alarm prevails
here. This hotel is constantly filling and emptying as
families leave the country, and set in a current to the
steamers. There is apprehension of some disturbance
between to-morrow night and Monday night (both inclusive),
and I learn this morning that all the drinking-shops
are to be closed from to-night until Tuesday. It is

<p>I daresay you know already that I held many councils
in London about coming to Ireland at all, and was much
against it. Everything looked as bad here as need be, but
we did very well last night after all.</p>

<p>There is considerable alarm here beyond all question,
and great depression in all kinds of trade and commerce.
To-morrow being St. Patrick's Day, there are apprehensions
of some disturbance, and croakers predict that it will come
off between to-night and Monday night. Of course there
are preparations on all sides, and large musters of soldiers
and police, though they are kept carefully out of sight.
One would not suppose, walking about the streets, that any
disturbance was impending; and yet there is no doubt that
the materials of one lie smouldering up and down the city
and all over the country. [I have a letter from Mrs. Bernal
Osborne this morning, describing the fortified way in which
she is living in her own house in the County Tipperary.]</p>

I should immediately stop the readings here. Should all
remain quiet, I begin to think they will be satisfactorily
remunerative after all. At Belfast, we shall have an
enormous house. I read "Copperfield" and "Bob" here
on Monday; "Marigold" and "Trial" at Belfast, on
Wednesday; and "Carol" and "Trial" here, on Friday.
This is all my news, except that I am in perfect force.</p>

<p>That the conspiracy is a far larger and more important
one than would seem from what it has done yet, there is no
doubt. I have had a good deal of talk with a certain
colonel, whose duty it has been to investigate it, day and
night, since last September. That it will give a world of
trouble, and cost a world of money, I take to be (after what
I have thus learned) beyond all question. One regiment
has been found to contain five hundred Fenian soldiers
every man of whom was sworn in the barrack-yard. How
information is swiftly and secretly conveyed all over the

<p>I am very doubtful indeed about "Vaux," and have
kept it out of the number in consequence. The mere
details of such a rascal's proceedings, whether recorded by
himself or set down by the Reverend Ordinary, are not
wholesome for a large audience, and are scarcely justifiable
(I think) as claiming to be a piece of literature. I can
understand Barrington to be a good subject, as involving
the representation of a period, a style of manners, an order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of dress, certain habits of street life, assembly-room life,
and coffee-room life, etc.; but there is a very broad distinction
between this and mere Newgate Calendar. The
latter would assuredly damage your book, and be protested
against to me. I have a conviction of it, founded on
constant observation and experience here.</p>

<p>Your kind invitation is extremely welcome and acceptable
to me, but I am sorry to add that I must not go
a-visiting. For this reason: So incessantly have I been
"reading," that I have not once been at home at Gad's
Hill since last January, and am little likely to get there
before the middle of May. Judge how the master's eye
must be kept on the place when it does at length get a look
at it after so long an absence! I hope you will descry in
this a reason for coming to me again, instead of my coming
to you.</p>

<p>The extinct prize-fighters, as a body, I take to be a
good subject, for much the same reason as George Barrington.
Their patrons were a class of men now extinct too, and the
whole ring of those days (not to mention Jackson's rooms
in Bond Street) is a piece of social history. Now Vaux
is not, nor is he even a phenomenon among thieves.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Stanny</span>,</div>

<p>The time of year reminds me how the months have
gone, since I last heard from you through Mrs. Stanfield.</p>

<p>I hope you have not thought me unmindful of you in the
meanwhile. I have been almost constantly travelling and
reading. England, Ireland, and Scotland have laid hold
of me by turns, and I have had no rest. As soon as I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
finished this kind of work last year, I had to fall to work
upon "All the Year Round" and the Christmas number. I
was no sooner quit of that task, and the Christmas season
was but run out to its last day, when I was tempted into
another course of fifty readings that are not yet over. I am
here now for two days, and have not seen the place since
Twelfth Night. When a reading in London has been done,
I have been brought up for it from some great distance, and
have next morning been carried back again. But the fifty
will be "paid out" (as we say at sea) by the middle of May,
and then I hope to see you.</p>

<p>Reading at Cheltenham the other day, I saw Macready,
who sent his love to you. His face was much more massive
and as it used to be, than when I saw him previous to his
illness. His wife takes admirable care of him, and is on
the happiest terms with his daughter Katie. His boy by
the second marriage is a jolly little fellow, and leads a far
easier life than the children you and I remember, who used
to come in at dessert and have each a biscuit and a glass of
water, in which last refreshment I was always convinced
that they drank, with the gloomiest malignity, "Destruction
to the gormandising grown-up company!"</p>

<p>I hope to look up your latest triumphs on the day of the
Academy dinner. Of course as yet I have had no opportunity
of even hearing of what anyone has done. I have
been (in a general way) snowed up for four months. The
locomotive with which I was going to Ireland was dug out
of the snow at midnight, in Wales. Both passages across
were made in a furious snowstorm. The snow lay ankle-deep
in Dublin, and froze hard at Belfast. In Scotland it
slanted before a perpetual east wind. In Yorkshire, it
derived novelty from thunder and lightning. Whirlwinds
everywhere I don't mention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>God bless you and yours. If I look like some weather-beaten
pilot when we meet, don't be surprised. Any mahogany-faced
stranger who holds out his hand to you will
probably turn out, on inspection, to be the old original
Dick.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Ever, my dear Stanny, your faithful and affectionate.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I wish you could have been with me (of course in
a snowstorm) one day on the pier at Tynemouth. There
was a very heavy sea running, and a perfect fleet of screw
merchantmen were plunging in and out on the turn of the
tide at high-water. Suddenly there came a golden horizon,
and a most glorious rainbow burst out, arching one large
ship, as if she were sailing direct for heaven. I was so
enchanted by the scene, that I became oblivious of a few
thousand tons of water coming on in an enormous roller,
and was knocked down and beaten by its spray when it
broke, and so completely wetted through and through, that
the very pockets in my pocket-book were full of sea.</p>

<p>When I came up to the house this afternoon and saw
what had happened, I had not the courage to ring, though
I had thought I was fully prepared by what I heard when I

have loved him more dearly than I always did, or can have

<p>Your poor mother has been constantly in my thoughts

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wills</span>,</div>

<p>I cannot tell you how warmly I feel your letter, or
how deeply I appreciate the affection and regard in which
it originates. I thank you for it with all my heart.</p>

<p>You will not suppose that I make light of any of your
misgivings if I present the other side of the question. Every
objection that you make strongly impresses me, and will be
revolved in my mind again and again.</p>

<p>When I went to America in '42, I was so much younger,
but (I think) very much weaker too. I had had a painful
surgical operation performed shortly before going out, and
had had the labour from week to week of "Master Humphrey's
Clock." My life in the States was a life of continual
speech-making (quite as laborious as reading), and I was less
patient and more irritable then than I am now. My idea of
a course of readings in America is, that it would involve far
less travelling than you suppose, that the large first-class
rooms would absorb the whole course, and that the receipts
would be very much larger than your estimate, unless the
demand for the readings is <span class="smcap">enormously exaggerated on all
hands</span>. There is considerable reason for this view of the
case. And I can hardly think that all the speculators who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
beset, and all the private correspondents who urge me, are
in a conspiracy or under a common delusion.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>I shall never rest much while my faculties last, and
(if I know myself) have a certain something in me that
would still be active in rusting and corroding me, if I
flattered myself that I was in repose. On the other hand,
I think that my habit of easy self-abstraction and withdrawal
into fancies has always refreshed and strengthened
me in short intervals wonderfully. I always seem to myself
to have rested far more than I have worked; and I do
really believe that I have some exceptional faculty of accumulating
young feelings in short pauses, which obliterates a
quantity of wear and tear.</p>

<p>My worldly circumstances (such a large family considered)
are very good. I don't want money. All my
possessions are free and in the best order. Still, at fifty-five
or fifty-six, the likelihood of making a very great addition
to one's capital in half a year is an immense consideration....
I repeat the phrase, because there should be something
large to set against the objections.</p>

<p>I dine with Forster to-day, to talk it over. I have no
doubt he will urge most of your objections and particularly
the last, though American friends and correspondents he
has, have undoubtedly staggered him more than I ever
knew him to be staggered on the money question. Be
assured that no one can present any argument to me which
will weigh more heartily with me than your kind words,
and that whatever comes of my present state of abeyance, I
shall never forget your letter or cease to be grateful for it.</p>

<p>I have read the first three numbers of Wilkie's
story this morning, and have gone minutely through the
plot of the rest to the last line. It gives a series of "narratives,"
but it is a very curious story, wild, and yet domestic,
with excellent character in it, and great mystery. It is
prepared with extraordinary care, and has every chance of
being a hit. It is in many respects much better than anything
he has done. The question is, how shall we fill up
the blank between Mabel's progress and Wilkie? What
do you think of proposing to Fitzgerald to do a story
three months long? I daresay he has some unfinished or
projected something by him.</p>

<p>I have an impression that it was not Silvester who tried
Eliza Fenning, but Knowles. One can hardly suppose
Thornbury to make such a mistake, but I wish you would
look into the Annual Register. I have added a final paragraph
about the unfairness of the judge, whoever he was.
I distinctly recollect to have read of his "putting down" of
Eliza Fenning's father when the old man made some
miserable suggestion in his daughter's behalf (this is not
noticed by Thornbury), and he also stopped some suggestion
that a knife thrust into a loaf adulterated with alum would
present the appearance that these knives presented. But I
may have got both these points from looking up some
pamphlets in Upcott's collection which I once had.</p>

<p>Your account of your journey reminds me of one of the
latest American stories, how a traveller by stage-coach said
to the driver: "Did you ever see a snail, sir?" "Yes,
sir." "Where did you meet him, sir?" "I <i>didn't</i> meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
him, sir!" "Wa'al, sir, I think you did, if you'll excuse
me, for I'm damned if you ever overtook him."</p>

<p>I was more shocked than surprised by the receipt of
your mother's announcement of our poor dear Marguerite's
death. When I heard of the consultation, and recalled
what had preceded it and what I have seen here, my hopes
were very slight.</p>

<p>Your letter did not reach me until last night, and thus I
could not avoid remaining here to-day, to keep an American
appointment of unusual importance. You and your mother
both know, I think, that I had a great affection for
Marguerite, that we had many dear remembrances together,
and that her self-reliance and composed perseverance had
awakened my highest admiration in later times. No one
could have stood by her grave to-day with a better knowledge
of all that was great and good in her than I have, or
with a more loving remembrance of her through all her
phases since she first came to London a pretty timid
girl.</p>

<p>I do not trouble your mother by writing to her separately.
It is a sad, sad task to write at all. God help us!</p>

<p>I have settled nothing yet about America, but am going
to send Dolby out on the 3rd of next month to survey the
land, and come back with a report on some heads whereon
I require accurate information. Proposals (both from
American and English speculators) of a very tempting
nature have been repeatedly made to me; but I cannot
endure the thought of binding myself to give so many
readings there whether I like it or no; and if I go at all,
am bent on going with Dolby single-handed.</p>

<p>I have been doing two things for America; one, the little
story to which you refer; the other, four little papers for a
child's magazine. I like them both, and think the latter a
queer combination of a child's mind with a grown-up joke.
I have had them printed to assure correct printing in the
United States. You shall have the proof to read, with the
greatest pleasure. On second thoughts, why shouldn't I
send you the children's proof by this same post? I will,
as I have it here, send it under another cover. When you

<p>I cannot get a boot on&mdash;wear a slipper on my left

is occasionally painful, but not very. I don't think it worth
while consulting anybody about it as yet. I make out so
many reasons against supposing it to be gouty, that I really
do not think it is.</p>

<p>Dolby begs me to send all manner of apologetic messages
for his going to America. He is very cheerful and hopeful,

very much. His sister<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was at Euston Square this morning,
looking very well. Sainton too, very light and jovial.</p>

<p>Like you, I was shocked when this new discovery
burst upon me on Friday, though, unlike you, I never could
believe in &mdash;&mdash;, solely (I think) because, often as I have
tried him, I never found him standing by my desk when I
was writing a letter without trying to read it.</p>

<p>I fear there is no doubt that since &mdash;&mdash;'s discharge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
he (&mdash;&mdash;) has stolen money at the readings. A case of an
abstracted shilling seems to have been clearly brought home
to him by Chappell's people, and they know very well what
<i>that</i> means. I supposed a very clear keeping off from
Anne's husband (whom I recommended for employment to
Chappell) to have been referable only to &mdash;&mdash;; but now I
see how hopeless and unjust it would be to expect belief
from him with two such cases within his knowledge.</p>

<p>But don't let the thing spoil your holiday. If we try to
do our duty by people we employ, by exacting their proper
service from them on the one hand, and treating them with
all possible consistency, gentleness, and consideration on the
other, we know that we do right. Their doing wrong cannot
change our doing right, and that should be enough for us.</p>

<p>So I have given <i>my</i> feathers a shake, and am all right
again. Give <i>your</i> feathers a shake, and take a cheery flutter
into the air of Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Great reports from Dolby and also from Fields! But I
keep myself quite calm, and hold my decision in abeyance
until I shall have book, chapter, and verse before me.
Dolby hoped he could leave Uncle Sam on the 11th of this
month.</p>

<p>Sydney has passed as a lieutenant, and appeared at home
yesterday, all of a sudden, with the consequent golden garniture
on his sleeve, which I, God forgive me, stared at
without the least idea that it meant promotion.</p>

<p>I am glad you see a certain unlikeness to anything in
the American story. Upon myself it has made the strangest
impression of reality and originality!! And I feel as if I
had read something (by somebody else), which I should
never get out of my mind!!! The main idea of the narrator's
position towards the other people was the idea that
I <i>had</i> for my next novel in A. Y. R. But it is very curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that I did not in the least see how to begin his state of

<p>If you were to write me many such warm-hearted

There is nothing that so breaks down my determination, or
shows me what an iron force I put upon myself, and how
weak it is, as a touch of true affection from a tried friend.</p>

<p>All that you so earnestly say about the goodwill and
devotion of all engaged, I perceived and deeply felt last
night. It moved me even more than the demonstration
itself, though I do suppose it was the most brilliant ever
seen. When I got up to speak, but for taking a desperate
hold of myself, I should have lost my sight and voice and
sat down again.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Mamie</span>,</div>

<p>We arrived here at seven this morning, and shall
probably remain awaiting our mail, until four or five this
afternoon. The weather in the passage here was delightful,
and we had scarcely any motion beyond that of the screw.</p>

<p>We are nearly but not quite full of passengers. At
table I sit next the captain, on his right, on the outside of
the table and close to the door. My little cabin is big enough
for everything but getting up in and going to bed in. As
it has a good window which I can leave open all night, and
a door which I can set open too, it suits my chief requirements
of it&mdash;plenty of air&mdash;admirably. On a writing-slab
in it, which pulls out when wanted, I now write in a majestic
manner.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers are American, and I am already
on the best terms with nearly all the ship.</p>

<p>We began our voyage yesterday a very little while after
you left us, which was a great relief. The wind is S.E. this
morning, and if it would keep so we should go along nobly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>

possible.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>As I wrote to Mamie last, I now write to you, or
mean to do it, if the motion of the ship will let me.</p>

<p>We are very nearly halfway to-day. The weather was
favourable for us until yesterday morning, when we got a
head-wind which still stands by us. We have rolled and
pitched, of course; but on the whole have been wonderfully
well off. I have had headache and have felt faint once or
twice, <i>but have not been sick at all</i>. My spacious cabin is
very noisy at night, as the most important working of the
ship goes on outside my window and over my head; but it
is very airy, and if the weather be bad and I can't open the
window, I can open the door all night. If the weather be
fine (as it is now), I can open both door and window, and
write between them. Last night, I got a foot-bath under
the dignified circumstances of sitting on a camp-stool in my
cabin, and having the bath (and my feet) in the passage outside.
The officers' quarters are close to me, and, as I know
them all, I get reports of the weather and the way we are
making when the watch is changed, and I am (as I usually
am) lying awake. The motion of the screw is at its slightest
vibration in my particular part of the ship. The silent
captain, reported gruff, is a very good fellow and an honest
fellow. Kelly has been ill all the time, and not of the
slightest use, and is ill now. Scott always cheerful, and
useful, and ready; a better servant for the kind of work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
there never can have been. Young Lowndes has been fearfully
sick until mid-day yesterday. His cabin is pitch dark,
and full of blackbeetles. He shares mine until nine o'clock
at night, when Scott carries him off to bed. He also dines
with me in my magnificent chamber. This passage in
winter time cannot be said to be an enjoyable excursion, but
I certainly am making it under the best circumstances. (I
find Dolby to have been enormously popular on board, and
to have known everybody and gone everywhere.)</p>

<p>So much for my news, except that I have been constantly
reading, and find that "Pierra" that Mrs. Hogge
sent me by Katie to be a very remarkable book, not only
for its grim and horrible story, but for its suggestion of
wheels within wheels, and sad human mysteries. Baker's
second book not nearly so good as his first, but his first
anticipated it.</p>

<p>We hope to get to Halifax either on Sunday or Monday,
and to Boston either on Tuesday or Wednesday. The glass
is rising high to-day, and everybody on board is hopeful of
an easterly wind.</p>

<i>Saturday, 16th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Last Thursday afternoon a heavy gale of wind sprang
up and blew hard until dark, when it seemed to lull. But
it then came on again with great violence, and blew tremendously
all night. The noise, and the rolling and plunging
of the ship, were awful. Nobody on board could get
any sleep, and numbers of passengers were rolled out of
their berths. Having a side-board to mine to keep me in,
like a baby, I lay still. But it was a dismal night indeed,
and it was curious to see the change it had made in the
faces of all the passengers yesterday. It cannot be denied
that these winter crossings are very trying and startling;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
while the personal discomfort of not being able to wash,
and the miseries of getting up and going to bed, with what
small means there are all sliding, and sloping, and slopping
about, are really in their way distressing.</p>

<p>This forenoon we made Cape Race, and are now running
along at full speed with the land beside us. Kelly still
useless, and positively declining to show on deck. Scott,
with an eight-day-old moustache, more super like than ever.
My foot (I hope from walking on the boarded deck) in a
very shy condition to-day, and rather painful. I shaved this
morning for the first time since Liverpool; dodging at the
glass, very much like Fechter's imitation of &mdash;&mdash;. The white
cat that came off with us in the tender a general favourite.
She belongs to the daughter of a Southerner, returning
with his wife and family from a two-years' tour in Europe.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Sunday, 17th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>At four o'clock this morning we got into bad weather
again, and the state of things at breakfast-time was unutterably
miserable. Nearly all the passengers in their
berths&mdash;no possibility of standing on deck&mdash;sickness and
groans&mdash;impracticable to pass a cup of tea from one pair of
hands to another. It has slightly moderated since (between
two and three in the afternoon I write), and the sun is
shining, but the rolling of the ship surpasses all imagination
or description.</p>

<p>We expect to be at Halifax about an hour after midnight,
and this letter shall be posted there, to make certain of
catching the return mail on Wednesday. Boston is only
thirty hours from Halifax.</p>

<p>Best love to Mamie, and to Katie and Charley. I know
you will report me and my love to Forster and Mrs. Forster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
I write with great difficulty, wedged up in a corner, and
having my heels on the paper as often as the pen. Kelly
worse than ever, and Scott better than ever.</p>

<p>My desk and I have just arisen from the floor.</p>

<span class="smcap">Parker House, Boston</span>, <i>Thursday, Nov. 21st, 1867.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I arrived here on Tuesday night, after a very slow
passage from Halifax against head-winds. All the tickets
for the first four readings here (all yet announced) were
sold immediately on their being issued.</p>

<p>You know that I begin on the 2nd of December with
"Carol" and "Trial"? Shall be heartily glad to begin to
count the readings off.</p>

<p>This is an immense hotel, with all manner of white
marble public passages and public rooms. I live in a
corner high up, and have a hot and cold bath in my bedroom
(communicating with the sitting-room), and comforts
not in existence when I was here before. The cost of living
is enormous, but happily we can afford it. I dine to-day
with Longfellow, Emerson, Holmes, and Agassiz. Longfellow
was here yesterday. Perfectly white in hair and
beard, but a remarkably handsome and notable-looking man.
The city has increased enormously in five-and-twenty years.
It has grown more mercantile&mdash;is like Leeds mixed with
Preston, and flavoured with New Brighton; but for smoke
and fog you substitute an exquisitely bright light air. I
found my rooms beautifully decorated (by Mrs. Fields)
with choice flowers, and set off by a number of good books.
I am not much persecuted by people in general, as Dolby
has happily made up his mind that the less I am exhibited
for nothing the better. So our men sit outside the room
door and wrestle with mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>We had speech-making and singing in the saloon of the
<i>Cuba</i> after the last dinner of the voyage. I think I have
acquired a higher reputation from drawing out the captain,
and getting him to take the second in "All's Well," and
likewise in "There's not in the wide world" (your parent
taking first), than from anything previously known of me
on these shores. I hope the effect of these achievements
may not dim the lustre of the readings. We also sang (with
a Chicago lady, and a strong-minded woman from I don't
know where) "Auld Lang Syne," with a tender melancholy,
expressive of having all four been united from our cradles.
The more dismal we were, the more delighted the company
were. Once (when we paddled i' the burn) the captain took
a little cruise round the compass on his own account, touching
at the "Canadian Boat Song," and taking in supplies at
"Jubilate," "Seas between us braid ha' roared," and
roared like the seas themselves. Finally, I proposed the
ladies in a speech that convulsed the stewards, and we closed
with a brilliant success. But when you dine with Mr. Forster,
ask him to read to you how we got on at church in a heavy
sea. Hillard has just been in and sent his love "to those
dear girls." He has grown much older. He is now District
Attorney of the State of Massachusetts, which is a very good
office. Best love to your aunt and Katie, and Charley and
all his house, and all friends.</p>

<p>I cannot remember to whom I wrote last, but it will not
much matter if I make a mistake; this being generally to
report myself so well, that I am constantly chafing at not
having begun to-night instead of this night week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The tickets being all sold for next week, and no other
announcement being yet made, there is nothing new in that
way to tell of. Dolby is over at New York, where we are
at our wits' end how to keep tickets out of the hands of
speculators. Morgan is staying with me; came yesterday
to breakfast, and goes home to-morrow. Fields and Mrs.
Fields also dined yesterday. She is a very nice woman,
with a rare relish for humour and a most contagious laugh.
The Bostonians having been duly informed that I wish to
be quiet, really leave me as much so as I should be in
Manchester or Liverpool. This I cannot expect to last elsewhere;
but it is a most welcome relief here, as I have all
the readings to get up. The people are perfectly kind and
perfectly agreeable. If I stop to look in at a shop-window,
a score of passers-by stop; and after I begin to read, I
cannot expect in the natural course of things to get off so
easily. But I every day take from seven to ten miles in
peace.</p>

<p>Communications about readings incessantly come in
from all parts of the country. We take no offer whatever,
lying by with our plans until after the first series in
New York, and designing, if we make a furore there, to
travel as little as possible. I fear I shall have to take
Canada at the end of the whole tour. They make such
strong representations from Montreal and Toronto, and
from Nova Scotia&mdash;represented by St. John's and Halifax&mdash;of
the slight it would be to them, if I wound up with the
States, that I am shaken.</p>

<p>It is sad to see Longfellow's house (the house in which his
wife was burnt) with his young daughters in it, and the
shadow of that terrible story. The young undergraduates
of Cambridge (he is a professor there) have made a representation
to him that they are five hundred strong, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
cannot get one ticket. I don't know what is to be done for
them; I suppose I must read there somehow. We are all
in the clouds until I shall have broken ground in New
York, as to where readings will be possible and where
impossible.</p>

<p>Agassiz is one of the most natural and jovial of men. I
go out a-visiting as little as I can, but still have to dine, and
what is worse, sup pretty often. Socially, I am (as I was
here before) wonderfully reminded of Edinburgh when I had
many friends in it.</p>

<p>Your account and Mamie's of the return journey to
London gave me great pleasure. I was delighted with
your report of Wilkie, and not surprised by Chappell's
coming out gallantly.</p>

<p>My anxiety to get to work is greater than I can express,
because time seems to be making no movement towards
home until I shall be reading hard. Then I shall begin to
count and count and count the upward steps to May.</p>

<p>If ever you should be in a position to advise a traveller
going on a sea voyage, remember that there is some mysterious
service done to the bilious system when it is shaken,
by baked apples. Noticing that they were produced on
board the <i>Cuba</i>, every day at lunch and dinner, I thought I
would make the experiment of always eating them freely.
I am confident that they did wonders, not only at the
time, but in stopping the imaginary pitching and rolling
after the voyage is over, from which many good amateur
sailors suffer. I have hardly had the sensation at all,
except in washing of a morning. At that time I still hold
on with one knee to the washing-stand, and could swear
that it rolls from left to right. The <i>Cuba</i> does not return
until Wednesday, the 4th December. You may suppose
that every officer on board is coming on Monday, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Dolby has provided extra stools for them. His work is
very hard indeed. Cards are brought to him every minute
in the day; his correspondence is immense; and he is jerked
off to New York, and I don't know where else, on the
shortest notice and the most unreasonable times. Moreover,
he has to be at "the bar" every night, and to "liquor up
with all creation" in the small hours. He does it all with
the greatest good humour, and flies at everybody who waylays
the Chief, furiously. We have divided our men into
watches, so that one always sits outside the drawing-room
door. Dolby knows the whole Cunard line, and as we could
not get good English gin, went out in a steamer yesterday
and got two cases (twenty-four bottles) out of Cunard
officers. Osgood and he were detached together last evening
for New York, whence they telegraph every other hour
about some new point in this precious sale of tickets. So
distracted a telegram arrived at three that I have telegraphed
back, "Explain yourselves," and am now waiting
for the explanation. I think you know that Osgood is a
partner in Ticknor and Fields'.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning.&mdash;Dolby has come back from New
York, where the prospects seem immense. We sell tickets
there next Friday and Saturday, and a tremendous rush
is expected.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Charley</span>,</div>

<p>You will have heard before now how fortunate I was
on my voyage, and how I was not sick for a moment.
These screws are tremendous ships for carrying on, and for
rolling, and their vibration is rather distressing. But my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
little cabin, being for'ard of the machinery, was in the best
part of the vessel, and I had as much air in it, night and
day, as I chose. The saloon being kept absolutely without
air, I mostly dined in my own den, in spite of my
being allotted the post of honour on the right hand of the
captain.</p>

<p>The tickets for the first four readings here (the only
readings announced) were all sold immediately, and many
are now re-selling at a large premium. The tickets for
the first four readings in New York (the only readings
announced there also) were on sale yesterday, and were all
sold in a few hours. The receipts are very large indeed;
but engagements of any kind and every kind I steadily
refuse, being resolved to take what is to be taken myself.
Dolby is nearly worked off his legs, is now at New York,
and goes backwards and forwards between this place and
that (about the distance from London to Liverpool, though
they take nine hours to do it) incessantly. Nothing can
exceed his energy and good humour, and he is extremely
popular everywhere. My great desire is to avoid much
travelling, and to try to get the people to come to me,
instead of my going to them. If I can effect this to any
moderate extent, I shall be saved a great deal of knocking
about. My original purpose was not to go to Canada at
all; but Canada is so up in arms on the subject that I think
I shall be obliged to take it at last. In that case I should
work round to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then take the
packet for home.</p>

<p>As they don't seem (Americans who have heard me on
their travels excepted) to have the least idea here of what
the readings are like, and as they are accustomed to mere
readings out of a book, I am inclined to think the excitement
will increase when I shall have begun. Everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
is very kind and considerate, and I have a number of old
friends here, at the Bar and connected with the University.
I am now negotiating to bring out the dramatic version of
"No Thoroughfare" at New York. It is quite upon the
cards that it may turn up trumps.</p>

<p>I was interrupted in that place by a call from my old
secretary in the States, Mr. Putnam. It was quite affecting
to see his delight in meeting his old master again. And
when I told him that Anne was married, and that I had
(unacknowledged) grandchildren, he laughed and cried
together. I suppose you don't remember Longfellow,
though he remembers you in a black velvet frock very well.
He is now white-haired and white-bearded, but remarkably
handsome. He still lives in his old house, where his beautiful
wife was burnt to death. I dined with him the other day,
and could not get the terrific scene out of my imagination.
She was in a blaze in an instant, rushed into his arms with
a wild cry, and never spoke afterwards.</p>

<p>My love to Bessie, and to Mekitty, and all the babbies.
I will lay this by until Tuesday morning, and then add a
final line to it.</p>

<p>I received yours of the 18th November, yesterday. As
I left Halifax in the <i>Cuba</i> that very day, you probably saw
us telegraphed in <i>The Times</i> on the 19th.</p>

<p>Dolby came back from another run to New York, this
morning. The receipts are very large indeed, far exceeding
our careful estimate made at Gad's. I think
you had best in future (unless I give you intimation to the
contrary) address your letters to me, at the Westminster
Hotel, Irving Place, New York City. It is a more central
position than this, and we are likely to be much more there
than here. I am going to set up a brougham in New York,
and keep my rooms at that hotel. The account of Matilda
is a very melancholy one, and really distresses me. What
she must sink into, it is sad to consider. However, there
was nothing for it but to send her away, that is quite
clear.</p>

<p>They are said to be a very quiet audience here, appreciative
but not demonstrative. I shall try to change their
character a little.</p>

<p>I have been going on very well. A horrible custom obtains
in these parts of asking you to dinner somewhere at half-past
two, and to supper somewhere else about eight. I have
run this gauntlet more than once, and its effect is, that there
is no day for any useful purpose, and that the length of the
evening is multiplied by a hundred. Yesterday I dined
with a club at half-past two, and came back here at half-past
eight, with a general impression that it was at least two
o'clock in the morning. Two days before I dined with
Longfellow at half-past two, and came back at eight, supposing
it to be midnight. To-day we have a state dinner-party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in our rooms at six, Mr. and Mrs. Fields, and Mr.
and Mrs. Bigelow. (He is a friend of Forster's, and was
American Minister in Paris). There are no negro waiters
here, all the servants are Irish&mdash;willing, but not able. The
dinners and wines are very good. I keep our own rooms
well ventilated by opening the windows, but no window is
ever opened in the halls or passages, and they are so overheated
by a great furnace, that they make me faint and
sick. The air is like that of a pre-Adamite ironing-day in
full blast. Your respected parent is immensely popular in
Boston society, and its cordiality and unaffected heartiness
are charming. I wish I could carry it with me.</p>

<p>The leading New York papers have sent men over for
to-morrow night with instructions to telegraph columns of
descriptions. Great excitement and expectation everywhere.
Fields says he has looked forward to it so long that he knows
he will die at five minutes to eight.</p>

<p>At the New York barriers, where the tickets are on sale
and the people ranged as at the Paris theatres, speculators
went up and down offering "twenty dollars for anybody's
place." The money was in no case accepted. One man sold
two tickets for the second, third, and fourth night for "one
ticket for the first, fifty dollars" (about seven pounds ten
shillings), "and a brandy cocktail," which is an iced bitter
drink. The weather has been rather muggy and languid
until yesterday, when there was the coldest wind blowing
that I ever felt. In the night it froze very hard, and to-day
the sky is beautiful.</p>

The people will hear of nothing else and talk of nothing
else. Nothing that was ever done here, they all agree,
evoked any approach to such enthusiasm. I was quite as
cool and quick as if I were reading at Greenwich, and went
at it accordingly. Tell your aunt, with my best love, that
I have this morning received hers of the 21st, and that I
will write to her next. That will be from New York. My

amazement with which I saw your remembrance of me
lying on my dressing-table here last Monday night. Whosoever
undertook that commission accomplished it to a
miracle. But you must go away four thousand miles, and
have such a token conveyed to <i>you</i>, before you can quite
appreciate the feeling of receiving it. Ten thousand loving
thanks.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>Immense success here, and unbounded enthusiasm. My
largest expectations far surpassed.</p>

<p>Amazing success here. A very fine audience; <i>far better
than that at Boston</i>. Great reception. Great, "Carol" and
"Trial," on the first night; still greater, "Copperfield"
and "Bob," on the second. Dolby sends you a few papers
by this post. You will see from their tone what a success
it is.</p>

<p>I cannot pay this letter, because I give it at the latest
moment to the mail-officer, who is going on board the
Cunard packet in charge of the mails, and who is staying
in this house. We are now selling (at the hall) the tickets
for the four readings of next week. At nine o'clock this
morning there were two thousand people in waiting, and
they had begun to assemble in the bitter cold as early as
two o'clock. All night long Dolby and our man have been
stamping tickets. (Immediately over my head, by-the-bye,
and keeping me awake.) This hotel is quite as quiet as
Mivart's, in Brook Street. It is not very much larger.
There are American hotels close by, with five hundred bedrooms,
and I don't know how many boarders; but this is
conducted on what is called "the European principle," and
is an admirable mixture of a first-class French and English
house. I keep a very smart carriage and pair; and if you
were to behold me driving out, furred up to the moustache,
with furs on the coach-boy and on the driver, and with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
immense white, red, and yellow striped rug for a covering,
you would suppose me to be of Hungarian or Polish
nationality.</p>

<p>Will you report the success here to Mr. Forster with my
love, and tell him he shall hear from me by next mail?</p>

<p>Dolby sends his kindest regards. He is just come in
from our ticket sales, and has put such an immense untidy
heap of paper money on the table that it looks like a family
wash. He hardly ever dines, and is always tearing about
at unreasonable hours. He works very hard.</p>

<p>My best love to your aunt (to whom I will write next),
and to Katie, and to both the Charleys, and all the Christmas
circle, not forgetting Chorley, to whom give my special
remembrance. You may get this by Christmas Day. <i>We</i>
shall have to keep it travelling from Boston here; for I
read at Boston on the 23rd and 24th, and here again on
the 26th.</p>

<p>We have been snowed up here, and the communication
with Boston is still very much retarded. Thus we have
received no letters by the Cunard steamer that came in last
Wednesday, and are in a grim state of mind on that
subject.</p>

<p>Last night I was getting into bed just at twelve o'clock,
when Dolby came to my door to inform me that the house
was on fire (I had previously smelt fire for two hours). I
got Scott up directly, told him to pack the books and
clothes for the readings first, dressed, and pocketed my
jewels and papers, while Dolby stuffed himself out with
money. Meanwhile the police and firemen were in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
house, endeavouring to find where the fire was. For some
time it baffled their endeavours, but at last, bursting out
through some stairs, they cut the stairs away, and traced it
to its source in a certain fire-grate. By this time the hose
was laid all through the house from a great tank on the
roof, and everybody turned out to help. It was the oddest
sight, and people had put the strangest things on! After
a little chopping and cutting with axes and handing about
of water, the fire was confined to a dining-room in which it
had originated, and then everybody talked to everybody
else, the ladies being particularly loquacious and cheerful.
And so we got to bed again at about two.</p>

<p>The excitement of the readings continues unabated, the
tickets for readings are sold as soon as they are ready, and
the public pay treble prices to the speculators who buy
them up. They are a wonderfully fine audience, even
better than Edinburgh, and almost, if not quite, as good as
Paris.</p>

<p>Dolby continues to be the most unpopular man in
America (mainly because he can't get four thousand people
into a room that holds two thousand), and is reviled in print
daily. Yesterday morning a newspaper proclaims of him:
"Surely it is time that the pudding-headed Dolby retired
into the native gloom from which he has emerged." He
takes it very coolly, and does his best. Mrs. Morgan sent
me, the other night, I suppose the finest and costliest basket
of flowers ever seen, made of white camellias, yellow roses,
pink roses, and I don't know what else. It is a yard and a
half round at its smallest part.</p>

<p>I must bring this to a close, as I have to go to the hall
to try an enlarged background.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>Sunday, Dec. 22nd, 1867.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Coming here from New York last night (after a detestable
journey), I was delighted to find your letter of the 6th.
I read it at my ten o'clock dinner with the greatest interest
and pleasure, and then we talked of home till we went to
bed.</p>

<p>Our tour is now being made out, and I hope to be able
to send it in my next letter home, which will be to Mamie,
from whom I have <i>not</i> heard (as you thought I had) by the
mail that brought out yours. After very careful consideration
I have reversed Dolby's original plan, and have decided
on taking Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, <i>Chicago</i> (!),
St. Louis, and a few other places nearer here, instead of
staying in New York. My reason is that we are doing
immensely, both at New York and here, and that I am sure
it is in the peculiar character of the people to prize a thing
the more the less easily attainable it is made. Therefore, I
want, by absence, to get the greatest rush and pressure upon
the five farewell readings in New York in April. All our
announced readings are already crammed.</p>

<p>When we got here last Saturday night, we found that
Mrs. Fields had not only garnished the rooms with flowers,
but also with holly (with real red berries) and festoons of
moss dependent from the looking-glasses and picture
frames. She is one of the dearest little women in the
world. The homely Christmas look of the place quite
affected us. Yesterday we dined at her house, and there
was a plum-pudding, brought on blazing, and not to be
surpassed in any house in England. There is a certain
Captain Dolliver, belonging to the Boston Custom House,
who came off in the little steamer that brought me ashore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
from the <i>Cuba</i>. He took it into his head that he would
have a piece of English mistletoe brought out in this
week's Cunard, which should be laid upon my breakfast-table.
And there it was this morning. In such affectionate
touches as this, these New England people are especially
amiable.</p>

<p>As a general rule, you may lay it down that whatever
you see about me in the papers is not true. But although
my voyage out was of that highly hilarious description that
you first made known to me, you may <i>generally</i> lend a
more believing ear to the Philadelphia correspondent of
<i>The Times</i>. I don't know him, but I know the source
from which he derives his information, and it is a very
respectable one.</p>

<p>Did I tell you in a former letter from here, to tell Anne,
with her old master's love, that I had seen Putnam, my old
secretary? Grey, and with several front teeth out, but I
would have known him anywhere. He is coming to
"Copperfield" to-night, accompanied by his wife and
daughter, and is in the seventh heaven at having his tickets
given him.</p>

<p>Our hotel in New York was on fire <i>again</i> the other
night. But fires in this country are quite matters of course.
There was a large one there at four this morning, and I
don't think a single night has passed since I have been
under the protection of the Eagle, but I have heard the fire
bells dolefully clanging all over the city.</p>

<p>Dolby sends his kindest regard. His hair has become
quite white, the effect, I suppose, of the climate. He is so
universally hauled over the coals (for no reason on earth),
that I fully expect to hear him, one of these nights, assailed
with a howl when he precedes me to the platform steps.
You may conceive what the low newspapers are here, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
one of them yesterday morning had, as an item of news,
the intelligence: "Dickens's Readings. The chap calling
himself Dolby got drunk last night, and was locked up in a
police-station for fighting an Irishman." I don't find that
anybody is shocked by this liveliness.</p>

<p>My love to all, and to Mrs. Hulkes and the boy. By-the-bye,
when we left New York for this place, Dolby called
my amazed attention to the circumstance that Scott was
leaning his head against the side of the carriage and weeping
bitterly. I asked him what was the matter, and he replied:
"The owdacious treatment of the luggage, which was more
outrageous than a man could bear." I told him not to make
a fool of himself; but they do knock it about cruelly. I
think every trunk we have is already broken.</p>

<p>I must leave off, as I am going out for a walk in a bright
sunlight and a complete break-up of the frost and snow. I
am much better than I have been during the last week, but
have a cold.</p>

<p>I got your aunt's last letter at Boston yesterday,
Christmas Day morning, when I was starting at eleven
o'clock to come back to this place. I wanted it very much,
for I had a frightful cold (English colds are nothing to those
of this country), and was exceedingly depressed and miserable.
Not that I had any reason but illness for being so,
since the Bostonians had been quite astounding in their
demonstrations. I never saw anything like them on
Christmas Eve. But it is a bad country to be unwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and travelling in; you are one of say a hundred people
in a heated car, with a great stove in it, and all the little
windows closed, and the hurrying and banging about are
indescribable. The atmosphere is detestable, and the
motion often all but intolerable. However, we got our
dinner here at eight o'clock, and plucked up a little, and
I made some hot gin punch to drink a merry Christmas
to all at home in. But it must be confessed that we were
both very dull. I have been in bed all day until two
o'clock, and here I am now (at three o'clock) a little better.
But I am not fit to read, and I must read to-night. After
watching the general character pretty closely, I became
quite sure that Dolby was wrong on the length of the stay
and the number of readings we had proposed in this place.
I am quite certain that it is one of the national peculiarities
that what they want must be difficult of attainment. I
therefore a few days ago made a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, and altered
the whole scheme. We shall go to Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington, also some New England towns between Boston
and this place, away to the falls of Niagara, and off far
west to Chicago and St. Louis, before coming back for ten
farewell readings here, preceded by farewells at Boston,
leaving Canada altogether. This will not prolong the list
beyond eighty-four readings, the exact original number,
and will, please God, work it all out in April. In my next,
I daresay, I shall be able to send the exact list, so that you
may know every day where we are. There has been a
great storm here for a few days, and the streets, though
wet, are becoming passable again. Dolby and Osgood are
out in it to-day on a variety of business, and left in grave
and solemn state. Scott and the gasman are stricken with
dumb concern, not having received one single letter from
home since they left. What their wives can have done with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the letters they take it for granted they have written, is
their stormy speculation at the door of my hall dressing-room
every night.</p>

<p>If I do not send a letter to Katie by this mail, it will be
because I shall probably be obliged to go across the water
to Brooklyn to-morrow to see a church, in which it is proposed
that I shall read!!! Horrible visions of being put in
the pulpit already beset me. And whether the audience
will be in pews is another consideration which greatly disturbs
my mind. No paper ever comes out without a leader
on Dolby, who of course reads them all, and never can
understand why I don't, in which he is called all the bad
names in (and not in) the language.</p>

<p>We always call him P. H. Dolby now, in consequence of
one of these graceful specimens of literature describing him
as the "pudding-headed."</p>

<p>I fear that when we travel he will have to be always
before me, so that I may not see him six times in as many
weeks. However, I shall have done a fourth of the whole
this very next week!</p>

<p>Best love to your aunt, and the boys, and Katie, and
Charley, and all true friends.</p>

<p>I managed to read last night, but it was as much as I
could do. To-day I am so very unwell, that I have sent for
a doctor; he has just been, and is in doubt whether I shall
not have to stop reading for a while.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>I am getting all right again. I have not been well,
been very low, and have been obliged to have a doctor; a
very agreeable fellow indeed, who soon turned out to be an
old friend of Olliffe's.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He has set me on my legs and taken
his leave "professionally," though he means to give me a
call now and then.</p>

<p>In the library at Gad's is a bound book, "Remarkable
Criminal Trials," translated by Lady Duff Gordon, from
the original by Fauerbach. I want that book, and a
copy of Praed's poems, to be sent out to Boston, care of
Ticknor and Fields. If you will give the "Criminal
Trials" to Wills, and explain my wish, and ask him to buy
a copy of Praed's poems and add it to the parcel, he will
know how to send the packet out. I think the "Criminal
Trials" book is in the corner book-case, by the window,
opposite the door.</p>

<p>No news here. All going on in the regular way. I
read in that church I told you of, about the middle of
January. It is wonderfully seated for two thousand people,
and is as easy to speak in as if they were two hundred.
The people are seated in pews, and we let the pews. I stood
on a small platform from which the pulpit will be removed
for the occasion!! I emerge from the vestry!!! Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and another two nights in Boston will
follow this coming month of January. On Friday next I
shall have read a fourth of my whole list, besides having
had twelve days' holiday when I first came out. So please
God I shall soon get to the half, and so begin to work
hopefully round.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<p>I suppose you were at the Adelphi on Thursday night
last. They are pirating the bill as well as the play here,
everywhere. I have registered the play as the property of
an American citizen, but the law is by no means clear that
I established a right in it by so doing; and of course the
pirates knew very well that I could not, under existing circumstances,
try the question with them in an American
court of law. Nothing is being played here scarcely that is
not founded on my books&mdash;"Cricket," "Oliver Twist,"
"Our Mutual Friend," and I don't know what else, every
night. I can't get down Broadway for my own portrait;
and yet I live almost as quietly in this hotel, as if I were at
the office, and go in and out by a side door just as I might
there.</p>

<p>I go back to Boston on Saturday to read there on
Monday and Tuesday. Then I am back here, and keep within
six or seven hours' journey of hereabouts till February.
My further movements shall be duly reported as the details
are arranged.</p>

<p>I shall be curious to know who were at Gad's Hill on
Christmas Day, and how you (as they say in this country)
"got along." It is exceedingly cold here again, after two
or three quite spring days.</p>

<h2>1868.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Charles Dickens</span> remained in America through the winter,
returning home from New York in the <i>Russia</i>, on the 19th
of April. His letters show how entirely he gave himself up
to the business of the readings, how severely his health<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
suffered from the climate, and from the perpetual travelling
and hard work, and yet how he was able to battle through
to the end. These letters are also full of allusions to the
many kind and dear friends who contributed so largely to
the pleasure of this American visit, and whose love and
attention gave a touch of <i>home</i> to his private life, and left
such affection and gratitude in his heart as he could never
forget. Many of these friends paid visits to Gad's Hill; the
first to come during this summer being Mr. Longfellow,
his daughters, and Mr. Appleton, brother-in-law of Mr.
Longfellow, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Eliot Norton, of
Cambridge.</div>

<p>For the future, there were to be no more Christmas
numbers of "All the Year Round." Observing the extent
to which they were now copied in all directions, Charles
Dickens supposed them likely to become tiresome to the
public, and so determined that in his journal they should
be discontinued.</p>

<p>While still in America, he made an agreement with the
Messrs. Chappell to give a series of farewell readings in
England, to commence in the autumn of this year. So, in
October, Charles Dickens started off again for a tour in the
provinces. He had for some time been planning, by way of
a novelty for this series, a reading from the murder in
"Oliver Twist," but finding it so very horrible, he was
fearful of trying its effect for the first time on a public
audience. It was therefore resolved, that a trial of it
should be made to a limited private audience in St. James's
Hall, on the evening of the 18th of November. This trial
proved eminently successful, and "The Murder from Oliver
Twist" became one of the most popular of his selections.
But the physical exertion it involved was far greater than
that of any of his previous readings, and added immensely
to the excitement and exhaustion which they caused him.</p>

<p>One of the first letters of the year from America is
addressed to Mr. Samuel Cartwright, of surgical and
artistic reputation, and greatly esteemed by Charles Dickens,
both in his professional capacity and as a private friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter written to Mrs. Cattermole, in May, tells of
the illness of Mr. George Cattermole. This dear old friend,
so associated with Charles Dickens and his works, died soon
afterwards, and the letter to his widow shows that Charles
Dickens was exerting himself in her behalf.</p>

<p>The play of "No Thoroughfare" having been translated
into French under the title of "L'Ab&icirc;me," Charles Dickens
went over to Paris to be present at the first night of its
production.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September, his youngest son, Edward
Bulwer Lytton (the "Plorn" so often mentioned), started
for Australia, to join his brother Alfred Tennyson, who was
already established there. It will be seen by his own words
how deeply and how sadly Charles Dickens felt this parting.
In October of this year, his son Henry Fielding entered
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as an undergraduate.</p>

<p>The Miss Forster mentioned in the letter to his sister-in-law,
and for whom the kind and considerate arrangements
were suggested, was a sister of Mr. John Forster, and a
lady highly esteemed by Charles Dickens. The illness from
which she was then suffering was a fatal one. She died in
this same year, a few days before Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Parkinson, to whom a letter is addressed,
was a gentleman holding a Government appointment, and
contributing largely to journalism and periodical literature.</p>

<p>As our last letter for this year, we give one which
Charles Dickens wrote to his youngest son on his departure
for Australia.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Georgy</span>,</div>

<p>I received yours of the 19th from Gad's and the office
this morning. I read here to-night, and go back to Boston
to-morrow, to read there Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>To-night, I read out the first quarter of my list. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
houses have been very fine here, but have never quite recovered
the Dolby uproar. It seems impossible to devise
any scheme for getting the tickets into the people's hands
without the intervention of speculators. The people <i>will
not</i> help themselves; and, of course, the speculators and all
other such prowlers throw as great obstacles in Dolby's way
(an Englishman's) as they possibly can. He may be a little
injudicious into the bargain. Last night, for instance, he
met one of the "ushers" (who show people to their seats)
coming in with Kelly. It is against orders that anyone employed
in front should go out during the readings, and he
took this man to task in the British manner. Instantly the
free and independent usher put on his hat and walked off.
Seeing which, all the other free and independent ushers (some
twenty in number) put on <i>their</i> hats and walked off, leaving
us absolutely devoid and destitute of a staff for to-night.
One has since been improvised; but it was a small matter
to raise a stir and ill will about, especially as one of our men
was equally in fault.</p>

<p>We have a regular clerk, a Bostonian whose name is
Wild. He, Osgood, Dolby, Kelly, Scott, George the gasman,
and perhaps a boy or two, constitute my body-guard.
It seems a large number of people, but the business cannot
be done with fewer. The speculators buying the front seats
to sell at a premium (and we have found instances of this
being done by merchants in good position!), and the public
perpetually pitching into Dolby for selling them back seats,
the result is that they won't have the back seats, send back
their tickets, write and print volumes on the subject, and
deter others from coming.</p>

<p>You may get an idea of the staff's work, by what is in
hand now. They are preparing, numbering, and stamping
six thousand tickets for Philadelphia, and eight thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
tickets for Brooklyn. The moment those are done,
another eight thousand tickets will be wanted for Baltimore,
and probably another six thousand for Washington.
This in addition to the correspondence, advertisements,
accounts, travellings, and the mighty business of the reading
four times a week.</p>

<p>The Cunard steamers being now removed from Halifax,
I have decided <i>not</i> to go there, or to St. John's, New
Brunswick. And as there would be a perfect uproar if I
picked out such a place in Canada as Quebec or Montreal,
and excluded those two places (which would guarantee
three hundred pounds a night), and further, as I don't want
places, having more than enough for my list of eighty-four,
I have finally resolved not to go to Canada either. This
will enable me to embark for home in April instead of
May.</p>

<p>Tell Plorn, with my love, that I think he will find himself
much interested at that college,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and that it is very likely
he may make some acquaintances there that will thereafter
be pleasant and useful to him. Sir Sydney Dacres is the
best of friends. I have a letter from Mrs. Hulkes by this
post, wherein the boy encloses a violet, now lying on the
table before me. Let her know that it arrived safely, and
retaining its colour. I took it for granted that Mary would
have asked Chorley for Christmas Day, and am very glad
she ultimately did so. I am sorry that Harry lost his prize,
but believe it was not his fault. Let <i>him</i> know <i>that</i>, with
my love. I would have written to him by this mail in answer
to his, but for other occupation. Did I tell you that my
landlord made me a drink (brandy, rum, and snow the
principal ingredients) called a "Rocky Mountain sneezer"?
Or that the favourite drink before you get up is an "eye-opener"?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Or that Roberts (second landlord), no sooner
saw me on the night of the first fire, than, with his property
blazing, he insisted on taking me down into a roomful of hot
smoke to drink brandy and water with him? We have not
been on fire again, by-the-bye, more than once.</p>

<p>There has been another fall of snow, succeeded by a
heavy thaw. I have laid down my sledge, and taken up my
carriage again, in consequence. I am nearly all right, but
cannot get rid of an intolerable cold in the head. No more
news.</p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Parker House, Boston, U.S.</span>, <i>Jan. 4th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I write to you by this opportunity, though I really have
nothing to tell you. The work is hard and the climate is
hard. We made a tremendous hit last night with "Nickleby"
and "Boots," which the Bostonians certainly on the whole
appreciate more than "Copperfield"! Dolby is always going
about with an immense bundle that looks like a sofa cushion,
but it is in reality paper money; and always works like a
Trojan. His business at night is a mere nothing, for these
people are so accustomed to take care of themselves, that
one of these immense audiences will fall into their places
with an ease amazing to a frequenter of St. James's Hall.
And the certainty with which they are all in, before I go
on, is a very acceptable mark of respect. I must add, too,
that although there is a conventional familiarity in the use
of one's name in the newspapers as "Dickens," "Charlie,"
and what not, I do not in the least see that familiarity in
the writers themselves. An inscrutable tone obtains in
journalism, which a stranger cannot understand. If I say
in common courtesy to one of them, when Dolby introduces,
"I am much obliged to you for your interest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
me," or so forth, he seems quite shocked, and has a bearing
of perfect modesty and propriety. I am rather inclined to
think that they suppose their printed tone to be the public's
love of smartness, but it is immensely difficult to make out.
All I can as yet make out is, that my perfect freedom
from bondage, and at any moment to go on or leave off,
or otherwise do as I like, is the only safe position to
occupy.</p>

<p>Again; there are two apparently irreconcilable contrasts
here. Down below in this hotel every night are the bar
loungers, dram drinkers, drunkards, swaggerers, loafers,
that one might find in a Boucicault play. Within half an
hour is Cambridge, where a delightful domestic life&mdash;simple,
self-respectful, cordial, and affectionate&mdash;is seen in
an admirable aspect. All New England is primitive and
puritanical. All about and around it is a puddle of mixed
human mud, with no such quality in it. Perhaps I may in
time sift out some tolerably intelligible whole, but I certainly
have not done so yet. It is a good sign, may be, that it all
seems immensely more difficult to understand than it was
when I was here before.</p>

<p>Felton left two daughters. I have only seen the eldest,
a very sensible, frank, pleasant girl of eight-and-twenty,
perhaps, rather like him in the face. A striking-looking
daughter of Hawthorn's (who is also dead) came into my
room last night. The day has slipped on to three o'clock,
and I must get up "Dombey" for to-night. Hence this
sudden break off. Best love to Mamie, and to Katie and
Charley Collins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wilkie</span>,</div>

<p>First, of the play.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I am truly delighted to learn
that it made so great a success, and I hope I may yet
see it on the Adelphi boards. You have had a world
of trouble and work with it, but I hope will be repaid
in some degree by the pleasure of a triumph. Even for
the alteration at the end of the fourth act (of which you
tell me in your letter received yesterday), I was fully prepared,
for I <span class="smcap">could not</span> see the original effect in the reading
of the play, and <span class="smcap">could not</span> make it go. I agree with
Webster in thinking it best that Obenreizer should die on
the stage; but no doubt that point is disposed of. In reading
the play before the representation, I felt that it was too
long, and that there was a good deal of unnecessary explanation.
Those points are, no doubt, disposed of too by
this time.</p>

<p>We shall do nothing with it on this side. Pirates are
producing their own wretched versions in all directions,
thus (as Wills would say) anticipating and glutting "the
market." I registered one play as the property of Ticknor
and Fields, American citizens. But, besides that the law
on the point is extremely doubtful, the manager of the
Museum Theatre, Boston, instantly announced his version.
(You may suppose what it is and how it is done, when I tell
you that it was playing within ten days of the arrival out
of the Christmas number.) Thereupon, Ticknor and Fields
gave him notice that he mustn't play it. Unto which he
replied, that he meant to play it and would play it. Of
course he knew very well that if an injunction were applied
for against him, there would be an immediate howl against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
my persecution of an innocent, and he played it. Then
the noble host of pirates rushed in, and it is being done,
in some mangled form or other, everywhere.</p>

<p>It touches me to read what you write of your poor mother.
But, of course, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do
give her my love, and tell her that I asked you about her.</p>

<p>I am going on here at the same great rate, but am
always counting the days that lie between me and home. I
got through the first fourth of my readings on Friday,
January 3rd. I leave for two readings at Philadelphia
this evening.</p>

<p>Being at Boston last Sunday, I took it into my head to
go over the medical school, and survey the holes and corners
in which that extraordinary murder was done by Webster.
There was the furnace&mdash;stinking horribly, as if the dismembered
pieces were still inside it&mdash;and there are all the
grim spouts, and sinks, and chemical appliances, and what
not. At dinner, afterwards, Longfellow told me a terrific
story. He dined with Webster within a year of the murder,
one of a party of ten or twelve. As they sat at their wine,
Webster suddenly ordered the lights to be turned out, and
a bowl of some burning mineral to be placed on the table,
that the guests might see how ghostly it made them look.
As each man stared at all the rest in the weird light, all
were horrified to see Webster <i>with a rope round his neck</i>,
holding it up, over the bowl, with his head jerked on one
side, and his tongue lolled out, representing a man being
hanged!</p>

<p>Poking into his life and character, I find (what I would
have staked my head upon) that he was always a cruel man.</p>

<p>So no more at present from,</p>

<div class='sig'>
My dear Wilkie, yours ever affectionately.<br />

<span class="smcap">Westminster Hotel, New York</span>, <i>Sunday, Jan. 12th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>As I am off to Philadelphia this evening, I may as well
post my letter here. I have scarcely a word of news. My
cold steadily refuses to leave me; but otherwise I am as
right as one can hope to be under this heavy work. My
New York readings are over (except four farewell nights in
April), and I look forward to the relief of being out of
my hardest hall. Last Friday night, though it was only
"Nickleby" and "Boots," I was again dead beat at the
end, and was once more laid upon a sofa. But the faintness
went off after a little while. We have now cold,
bright, frosty weather, without snow&mdash;the best weather
for me.</p>

<p>Having been in great trepidation about the play, I am
correspondingly elated by the belief that it really <i>is</i> a success.
No doubt the unnecessary explanations will have been taken
out, and the flatness of the last act fetched up. At some
points I could have done wonders to it, in the way of
screwing it up sharply and picturesquely, if I could have
rehearsed it. Your account of the first night interested me
immensely, but I was afraid to open the letter until Dolby
rushed in with the opened <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I come back here for my four church
readings at Brooklyn. Each evening an enormous ferryboat
will convey me and my state carriage (not to mention
half-a-dozen waggons, and any number of people, and a few
score of horses) across the river, and will bring me back
again. The sale of tickets there was an amazing scene.
The noble army of speculators are now furnished (this is
literally true, and I am quite serious), each man with a straw
mattress, a little bag of bread and meat, two blankets, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a bottle of whisky. With this outfit <i>they lie down in line
on the pavement</i> the whole night before the tickets are sold,
generally taking up their position at about ten. It being
severely cold at Brooklyn, they made an immense bonfire in
the street&mdash;a narrow street of wooden houses!&mdash;which the
police turned out to extinguish. A general fight then took
place, out of which the people farthest off in the line rushed
bleeding when they saw a chance of displacing others near
the door, and put their mattresses in those places, and then
held on by the iron rails. At eight in the morning Dolby
appeared with the tickets in a portmanteau. He was
immediately saluted with a roar of "Halloa, Dolby! So
Charley has let you have the carriage, has he, Dolby!
How is he, Dolby! Don't drop the tickets, Dolby! Look
alive, Dolby!" etc. etc. etc., in the midst of which he
proceeded to business, and concluded (as usual) by giving
universal dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>He is now going off upon a little journey "to look over
the ground and cut back again." This little journey (to
Chicago) is fifteen hundred miles on end, by railway, and
back again!</p>

<p>We have an excellent gasman, who is well up to that
department. We have enlarged the large staff by another
clerk, yet even now the preparation of such an immense
number of new tickets constantly, and the keeping and
checking of the accounts, keep them hard at it. And they
get so oddly divided! Kelly is at Philadelphia, another
man at Baltimore, two others are stamping tickets at the
top of this house, another is cruising over New England,
and Osgood will come on duty to-morrow (when Dolby
starts off) to pick me up after the reading, and take me to
the hotel, and mount guard over me, and bring me back
here. You see that even such wretched domesticity as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Dolby and self by a fireside is broken up under these
conditions.</p>

<p>Dolby has been twice poisoned, and Osgood once.
Morgan's sharpness has discovered the cause. When the
snow is deep upon the ground, and the partridges cannot
get their usual food, they eat something (I don't know
what, if anybody does) which does not poison <i>them</i>, but
which poisons the people who eat them. The symptoms,
which last some twelve hours, are violent sickness, cold
perspiration, and the formation of some detestable mucus in
the stomach. You may infer that partridges have been
banished from our bill of fare. The appearance of our
sufferers was lamentable in the extreme.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that the severity of the weather, and the
heat of the intolerable furnaces, dry the hair and break the
nails of strangers? There is not a complete nail in the
whole British suite, and my hair cracks again when I brush
it. (I am losing my hair with great rapidity, and what I
don't lose is getting very grey.)</p>

<p>The <i>Cuba</i> will bring this. She has a jolly new captain&mdash;Moody,
of the <i>Java</i>&mdash;and her people rushed into the
reading, the other night, captain-headed, as if I were their
peculiar property. Please God I shall come home in her,
in my old cabin; leaving here on the 22nd of April, and
finishing my eighty-fourth reading on the previous night!
It is likely enough that I shall read and go straight on
board.</p>

<p>I think this is all my poor stock of intelligence. By-the-bye,
on the last Sunday in the old year, I lost my old
year's pocket-book, "which," as Mr. Pepys would add,
"do trouble me mightily." Give me Katie's new address;
I haven't got it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>Monday, Jan. 13th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I write you this note, a day later than your aunt's,
not because I have anything to add to the little I have told
her, but because you may like to have it.</p>

<p>We arrived here last night towards twelve o'clock, more
than an hour after our time. This is one of the immense
American hotels (it is called the Continental); but I find
myself just as quiet here as elsewhere. Everything is very
good indeed, the waiter is German, and the greater part
of the house servants seem to be coloured people. The
town is very clean, and the day as blue and bright as a fine
Italian day. But it freezes very hard. All the tickets
being sold here for six nights (three visits of two nights
each), the suite complain of want of excitement already,
having been here ten hours! Mr. and Mrs. Barney
Williams, with a couple of servants, and a pretty little
child-daughter, were in the train each night, and I talked
with them a good deal. They are reported to have made
an enormous fortune by acting among the Californian
gold-diggers. My cold is no better, for the cars are so
intolerably hot, that I was often obliged to go and stand
upon the break outside, and then the frosty air was biting
indeed. The great man of this place is one Mr. Childs, a
newspaper proprietor, and he is so exactly like Mr. Esse in
all conceivable respects except being an inch or so taller,
that I was quite confounded when I saw him waiting for me
at the station (always called dep&ocirc;t here) with his carriage.
During the last two or three days, Dolby and I have been
making up accounts, which are excellently kept by Mr.
Osgood, and I find them amazing, quite, in their results.</p>

<p>I was very much interested in the home accounts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Christmas Day. I think I have already mentioned that we
were in very low spirits on that day. I began to be unwell
with my cold that morning, and a long day's travel did not
mend the matter. We scarcely spoke (except when we ate
our lunch), and sat dolefully staring out of window. I had
a few affectionate words from Chorley, dated from my room,
on Christmas morning, and will write him, probably by this
mail, a brief acknowledgment. I find it necessary (so
oppressed am I with this American catarrh, as they call it)
to dine at three o'clock instead of four, that I may have
more time to get voice, so that the days are cut short, and
letter-writing is not easy.</p>

<p>My best love to Katie, and to Charley, and to our
Charley, and to all friends. If I could only get to the point
of being able to hold my head up and dispense with my
pocket-handkerchief for five minutes, I should be all right.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Charley</span>,</div>

<p>Finding your letter here this afternoon on my return
from Philadelphia (where I have been reading two nights),
I take advantage of a spare half-hour in which to answer it
at once, though it will not leave here until Saturday. I had
previously heard of the play, and had <i>The Times</i>. It was a
great relief and delight to me, for I had no confidence in its
success; being reduced to the confines of despair by its
length. If I could have rehearsed it, I should have taken
the best part of an hour out of it. Fechter must be very
fine, and I should greatly like to see him play the part.</p>

<p>I have not been very well generally, and am oppressed
(and I begin to think that I probably shall be until I leave)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
by a true American cold, which I hope, for the comfort of
human nature, may be peculiar to only one of the four
quarters of the world. The work, too, is very severe. But
I am going on at the same tremendous rate everywhere.
The staff, too, has had to be enlarged. Dolby was at Baltimore
yesterday, is at Washington to-day, and will come back
in the night, and start away again on Friday. We find it
absolutely necessary for him to go on ahead. We have not
printed or posted a single bill here, and have just sold ninety
pounds' worth of paper we had got ready for bills. In such
a rush a short newspaper advertisement is all we want.
"Doctor Marigold" made a great hit here, and is looked
forward to at Boston with especial interest. I go to Boston
for another fortnight, on end, the 24th of February. The
railway journeys distress me greatly. I get out into the open
air (upon the break), and it snows and blows, and the train
bumps, and the steam flies at me, until I am driven in again.</p>

<p>I have finished here (except four farewell nights in
April), and begin four nights at Brooklyn, on the opposite
side of the river, to-night; and thus oscillate between
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and then cut into
New England, and so work my way back to Boston for a
fortnight, after which come Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit
and Cleveland, and Buffalo, and then Philadelphia, Boston,
and New York farewells. I will not pass my original bound
of eighty-four readings in all. My mind was made up as
to that long ago. It will be quite enough. Chicago is some
fifteen hundred miles from here. What with travelling,
and getting ready for reading, and reading, the days are
pretty fully occupied. Not the less so because I rest very
indifferently at night.</p>

<p>The people are exceedingly kind and considerate, and
desire to be most hospitable besides. But I cannot accept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
hospitality, and never go out, except at Boston, or I should
not be fit for the labour. If Dolby holds out well to the
last it will be a triumph, for he has to see everybody, drink
with everybody, sell all the tickets, take all the blame, and
go beforehand to all the places on the list. I shall not see
him after to-night for ten days or a fortnight, and he will
be perpetually on the road during the interval. When he
leaves me, Osgood, a partner in Ticknor and Fields' publishing
firm, mounts guard over me, and has to go into
the hall from the platform door every night, and see how
the public are seating themselves. It is very odd to see
how hard he finds it to look a couple of thousand people in
the face, on which head, by-the-bye, I notice the papers
to take "Mr. Dickens's extraordinary composure" (their
great phrase) rather ill, and on the whole to imply that it
would be taken as a suitable compliment if I would stagger
on to the platform and instantly drop, overpowered by the
spectacle before me.</p>

<p>Dinner is announced (by Scott, with a stiff neck and a
sore throat), and I must break off with love to Bessie and
the incipient Wenerableses. You will be glad to hear of
your distinguished parent that Philadelphia has discovered
that "he is not like the descriptions we have read of him at
the little red desk. He is not at all foppish in appearance.
He wears a heavy moustache and a Vandyke beard, and
looks like a well-to-do Philadelphian gentleman."</p>

<div class='sig'>
Ever, my dear Charley, your affectionate Father.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Your paper is remarkably good. There is not the
least doubt that you can write constantly for A. Y. R. I
am very pleased with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>This will be but a very short report, as I must get out
for a little exercise before dinner.</p>

<p>My "true American catarrh" (the people seem to have
a national pride in it) sticks to me, but I am otherwise
well. I began my church readings last night, and it was
very odd to see the pews crammed full of people, all in a
broad roar at the "Carol" and "Trial."</p>

<p>Best love to all. I have written Charley a few lines by
this mail, and also Chorley.</p>

</div>

<p>I finished my church to-night. It is Mrs. Stowe's
brother's, and a most wonderful place to speak in. We had
it enormously full last night ("Marigold" and "Trial"),
but it scarcely required an effort. Mr. Ward Beecher (Mrs.
Stowe's brother's name) being present in his pew. I sent
to invite him to come round before he left; and I found
him to be an unostentatious, straightforward, and agreeable
fellow.</p>

<p>My cold sticks to me, and I can scarcely exaggerate
what I sometimes undergo from sleeplessness. The day
before yesterday I could get no rest until morning, and
could not get up before twelve. This morning the same. I
rarely take any breakfast but an egg and a cup of tea, not
even toast or bread-and-butter. My dinner at three, and a
little quail or some such light thing when I come home at
night, is my daily fare. At the Hall I have established the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
custom of taking an egg beaten up in sherry before going
in, and another between the parts. I think that pulls me
up; at all events, I have since had no return of faintness.</p>

<p>As the men work very hard, and always with their
hearts cheerfully in the business, I cram them into and
outside of the carriage, to bring them back from Brooklyn
with me. The other night, Scott (with a portmanteau
across his knees and a wideawake hat low down upon his
nose) told me that he had presented himself for admission
in the circus (as good as Franconi's, by-the-bye), and had
been refused. "The only theayter," he said in a melancholy
way, "as I was ever in my life turned from the door
of." Says Kelly: "There must have been some mistake,
Scott, because George and me went, and we said, 'Mr.
Dickens's staff,' and they passed us to the best seats in the
house. Go again, Scott." "No, I thank you, Kelly," says
Scott, more melancholy than before, "I'm not a-going to
put myself in the position of being refused again. It's the
only theayter as I was ever turned from the door of, and
it shan't be done twice. But it's a beastly country!"
"Scott," interposed Majesty, "don't you express your
opinions about the country." "No, sir," says Scott, "I
never do, please, sir, but when you are turned from the
door of the only theayter you was ever turned from,
sir, and when the beasts in railway cars spits tobacco
over your boots, you (privately) find yourself in a beastly
country."</p>

<p>I expect shortly to get myself snowed up on some railway
or other, for it is snowing hard now, and I begin to
move to-morrow. There is so much floating ice in the
river that we are obliged to leave a pretty wide margin of
time for getting over the ferry to read. The dinner is
coming in, and I must leave off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>When I wrote to your aunt by the last mail, I accidentally
omitted to touch upon the question of helping
Anne. So I will begin in this present writing with
reference to her sad position. I think it will be best for
you to be guided by an exact knowledge of her <i>wants</i>.
Try to ascertain from herself what means she has, whether
her sick husband gets what he ought to have, whether she
is pinched in the articles of necessary clothing, bedding, or
the like of that; add to this intelligence your own observation
of the state of things about her, and supply what
she most wants, and help her where you find the greatest
need. The question, in the case of so old and faithful a
servant, is not one of so much or so little money on my
side, but how <i>most efficiently</i> to ease her mind and help <i>her</i>.
To do this at once kindly and sensibly is the only consideration
by which you have to be guided. Take <i>carte blanche</i>
from me for all the rest.</p>

<p>My Washington week is the first week in February,
beginning on Monday, 3rd. The tickets are sold, and the
President is coming, and the chief members of the Cabinet,
and the leaders of parties, and so forth, are coming; and,
as the Holly Tree Boots says: "That's where it is, don't
you see!"</p>

<p>In my Washington doubts I recalled Dolby for conference,
and he joined me yesterday afternoon, and we have
been in great discussion ever since on the possibility of
giving up the Far West, and avoiding such immense distances
and fatigues as would be involved in travelling to
Chicago and Cincinnati. We have sketched another tour
for the last half of March, which would be infinitely easier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
for me, though on the other hand less profitable, the places
and the halls being smaller. The worst of it is, that everybody
one advises with has a monomania respecting Chicago.
"Good heaven, sir," the great Philadelphian authority said
to me this morning, "if you don't read in Chicago, the
people will go into fits." In reference to fatigue, I
answered: "Well, I would rather they went into fits than I
did." But he didn't seem to see it at all. &mdash;&mdash; alone
constantly writes me: "Don't go to the West; you can get
what you want so much more easily." How we shall finally
decide, I don't yet know. My Brooklyn church has been
an immense success, and I found its minister was a bachelor,
a clever, unparsonic, and straightforward man, and a man
with a good knowledge of art into the bargain.</p>

<p>We are not a bit too soon here, for the whole country is
beginning to be stirred and shaken by the presidential
election, and trade is exceedingly depressed, and will be
more so. Fanny Kemble lives near this place, but had
gone away a day before my first visit here. <i>She</i> is going to
read in February or March. Du Chaillu has been lecturing
out West about the gorilla, and has been to see me; I saw
the Cunard steamer <i>Persia</i> out in the stream, yesterday,
beautifully smart, her flags flying, all her steam up, and she
only waiting for her mails to slip away. She gave me a
horrible touch of home-sickness.</p>

<p>When the 1st of March arrives, and I can say "next
month," I shall begin to grow brighter. A fortnight's
reading in Boston, too (last week of February and first
week of March), will help me on gaily, I hope (the work so
far off tells). It is impossible for the people to be more
affectionately attached to a third, I really believe, than
Fields and his wife are to me; and they are a landmark in
the prospect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolby sends kindest regards, and wishes it to be known
that he has not been bullied lately. We do <i>not</i> go West at
all, but take the easier plan.</p>

<p>As I have an hour to spare, before starting to Philadelphia,
I begin my letter this morning. It has been
snowing hard for four-and-twenty hours, though this place
is as far south as Valentia in Spain; and Dolby, being on
his way to New York, has a good chance of being snowed
up somewhere.</p>

<p>They are a bright responsive people here, and very
pleasant to read to. I have rarely seen so many fine faces
in an audience. I read here in a charming little opera-house
built by a society of Germans, quite a delightful
place for the purpose. I stand on the stage, with a drop
curtain down, and my screen before it. The whole scene
is very pretty and complete, and the audience have a "ring"
in them that sounds in the ear. I go from here to Philadelphia
to read to-morrow night and Friday, come through
here again on Saturday on my way to Washington, come
back here on Saturday week for two finishing nights, then
go to Philadelphia for two farewells, and so turn my back
on the southern part of the country. Distances and
travelling have obliged us to reduce the list of readings by
two, leaving eighty-two in all. Of course we afterwards
discovered that we had finally settled the list on a Friday!
I shall be halfway through it at Washington, of course, on
a Friday also, and my birthday!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolby and Osgood, who do the most ridiculous things to
keep me in spirits (I am often very heavy, and rarely sleep
much), have decided to have a walking-match at Boston, on
Saturday, February 29th. Beginning this design in joke,
they have become tremendously in earnest, and Dolby has
actually sent home (much to his opponent's terror) for
a pair of seamless socks to walk in. Our men are hugely
excited on the subject, and continually make bets on "the
men." Fields and I are to walk out six miles, and "the
men" are to turn and walk round us. Neither of them has
the least idea what twelve miles at a pace is. Being requested
by both to give them "a breather" yesterday, I
gave them a stiff one of five miles over a bad road in the
snow, half the distance uphill. I took them at a pace
of four miles and a half an hour, and you never beheld such
objects as they were when we got back; both smoking like
factories, and both obliged to change everything before
they could come to dinner. They have the absurdest ideas
of what are tests of walking power, and continually get up
in the maddest manner and see <i>how high they can kick</i> the
wall! The wainscot here, in one place, is scored all over
with their pencil-marks. To see them doing this&mdash;Dolby, a
big man, and Osgood, a very little one, is ridiculous beyond
description.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>Same Night.</i><br />
</div>

<p>We came on here through a snowstorm all the way, but
up to time. Fanny Kemble (who begins to read shortly) is
coming to "Marigold" and "Trial" to-morrow night. I
have written her a note, telling her that if it will at all assist
<i>her</i> movements to know <i>mine</i>, my list is at her service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Probably I shall see her to-morrow. Tell Mamie (to whom I
will write next), with my love, that I found her letter of the
10th of this month awaiting me here. The <i>Siberia</i> that
brought it is a new Cunarder, and made an unusually slow
passage out. Probably because it would be dangerous to
work new machinery too fast on the Atlantic.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Thursday, 30th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>My cold still sticks to me. The heat of the railway
cars and their unventilated condition invariably brings it
back when I think it going. This morning my head is
as stuffed and heavy as ever! A superb sledge and four
horses have been offered me for a ride, but I am afraid to
take it, lest I should make the "true American catarrh"
worse, and should get hoarse. So I am going to give
Osgood another "breather" on foot instead.</p>

<p>The communication with New York is not interrupted,
so we consider the zealous Dolby all right. You may
imagine what his work is, when you hear that he goes three
times to every place we visit. Firstly, to look at the hall,
arrange the numberings, and make five hundred acquaintances,
whom he immediately calls by their christian-names;
secondly, to sell the tickets&mdash;a very nice business, requiring
great tact and temper; thirdly, with me. He will probably
turn up at Washington next Sunday, but only for a little
while; for as soon as I am on the platform on Monday
night, he will start away again, probably to be seen no
more until we pass through New York in the middle of
February.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, <i>Wednesday, Jan. 29th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cartwright</span>,</div>

<p>As I promised to report myself to you from this side
of the Atlantic, and as I have some leisure this morning, I
am going to lighten my conscience by keeping my word.</p>

<p>I am going on at a great pace and with immense success.
Next week, at Washington, I shall, please God, have got
through half my readings. The remaining half are all
arranged, and they will carry me into the third week of
April. It is very hard work, but it is brilliantly paid. The
changes that I find in the country generally (this place is
the least changed of any I have yet seen) exceed my utmost
expectations. I had been in New York a couple of days
before I began to recognise it at all; and the handsomest
part of Boston was a black swamp when I saw it five-and-twenty
years ago. Considerable advances, too, have been
made socially. Strange to say, the railways and railway
arrangements (both exceedingly defective) seem to have
stood still while all other things have been moving.</p>

<p>One of the most comical spectacles I have ever seen in
my life was "church," with a heavy sea on, in the saloon of
the Cunard steamer coming out. The officiating minister,
an extremely modest young man, was brought in between
two big stewards, exactly as if he were coming up to the
scratch in a prize-fight. The ship was rolling and pitching
so, that the two big stewards had to stop and watch their
opportunity of making a dart at the reading-desk with their
reverend charge, during which pause he held on, now by
one steward and now by the other, with the feeblest expression
of countenance and no legs whatever. At length they
made a dart at the wrong moment, and one steward was
immediately beheld alone in the extreme perspective, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the other and the reverend gentleman <i>held on by the mast</i>
in the middle of the saloon&mdash;which the latter embraced with
both arms, as if it were his wife. All this time the congregation
was breaking up into sects and sliding away; every
sect (as in nature) pounding the other sect. And when at
last the reverend gentleman had been tumbled into his place,
the desk (a loose one, put upon the dining-table) deserted
from the church bodily, and went over to the purser. The
scene was so extraordinarily ridiculous, and was made so
much more so by the exemplary gravity of all concerned in
it, that I was obliged to leave before the service began.</p>

<p>This is one of the places where Butler carried it with so
high a hand in the war, and where the ladies used to spit
when they passed a Northern soldier. It still wears, I fancy,
a look of sullen remembrance. (The ladies are remarkably
handsome, with an Eastern look upon them, dress with a
strong sense of colour, and make a brilliant audience.) The
ghost of slavery haunts the houses; and the old, untidy,
incapable, lounging, shambling black serves you as a free
man. Free of course he ought to be; but the stupendous
absurdity of making him a voter glares out of every roll of
his eye, stretch of his mouth, and bump of his head. I
have a strong impression that the race must fade out of the
States very fast. It never can hold its own against a
striving, restless, shifty people. In the penitentiary here,
the other day, in a room full of all blacks (too dull to be
taught any of the work in hand), was one young brooding
fellow, very like a black rhinoceros. He sat glowering at
life, as if it were just endurable at dinner time, until four of
his fellows began to sing, most unmelodiously, a part song.
He then set up a dismal howl, and pounded his face on
a form. I took him to have been rendered quite desperate
by having learnt anything. I send my kind regard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Mrs. Cartwright, and sincerely hope that she and you have no
new family distresses or anxieties. My standing address is

<p>Since writing to your aunt I have received yours of
the 7th, and am truly glad to have the last news of you
confirmed by yourself.</p>

<p>From a letter Wilkie has written to me, it seems there
can be no doubt that the "No Thoroughfare" drama is a
real, genuine, and great success. It is drawing immensely,
and seems to "go" with great effect and applause.</p>

<p>"Doctor Marigold" here last night (for the first time)
was an immense success, and all Philadelphia is going to
rush at once for tickets for the two Philadelphian farewells
the week after next. The tickets are to be sold to-morrow,
and great excitement is anticipated in the streets. Dolby
not being here, a clerk will sell, and will probably wish
himself dead before he has done with it.</p>

<p>It appears to me that Chorley<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> writes to you on the
legacy question because he wishes you to understand that
there is no danger of his changing his mind, and at the
bottom I descry an honest desire to pledge himself as
strongly as possible. You may receive it in that better
spirit, or I am much mistaken. Tell your aunt, with my
best love, that I wrote to Chauncey weeks ago, in answer
to a letter from him. I am now going out in a sleigh (and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>

which reminds me that I am informed by trusty scouts

even descend upon me in the train to-morrow.</p>

<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>Tuesday, Feb. 4th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I began here last night with great success. The hall
being small, the prices were raised to three dollars each
ticket. The audience was a superior one, composed of the
foremost public men and their families. At the end of the
"Carol" they gave a great break out, and applauded, I really
believe, for five minutes. You would suppose them to be
Manchester shillings instead of Washington half-sovereigns.
Immense enthusiasm.</p>

<p>A devoted adherent in this place (an Englishman) had
represented to Dolby that if I were taken to an hotel here
it would be impossible to secure me a minute's rest, and he
undertook to get one Wheleker, a German, who keeps a
little V&eacute;rey's, to furnish his private dining-rooms for the
illustrious traveller's reception. Accordingly here we are,
on the first and second floor of a small house, with no one
else in it but our people, a French waiter, and a very good
French cuisine. Perfectly private, in the city of all the
world (I should say) where the hotels are intolerable,
and privacy the least possible, and quite comfortable.
"Wheleker's Restaurant" is our rather undignified address
for the present week.</p>

<p>I dined (against my rules) with Charles Sumner on
Sunday, he having been an old friend of mine. Mr.
Secretary Staunton (War Minister) was there. He is a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of a very remarkable memory, and famous for his acquaintance
with the minutest details of my books. Give him any
passage anywhere, and he will instantly cap it and go on
with the context. He was commander-in-chief of all the
Northern forces concentrated here, and never went to sleep
at night without first reading something from my books,
which were always with him. I put him through a pretty
severe examination, but he was better up than I was.</p>

<p>The gas was very defective indeed last night, and I
began with a small speech, to the effect that I must trust
to the brightness of their faces for the illumination of
mine; this was taken greatly. In the "Carol," a most
ridiculous incident occurred all of a sudden. I saw a dog
look out from among the seats into the centre aisle, and look
very intently at me. The general attention being fixed on
me, I don't think anybody saw the dog; but I felt so sure
of his turning up again and barking, that I kept my eye
wandering about in search of him. He was a very comic
dog, and it was well for me that I was reading a very comic
part of the book. But when he bounced out into the centre
aisle again, in an entirely new place (still looking intently
at me) and tried the effect of a bark upon my proceedings,
I was seized with such a paroxysm of laughter, that it communicated
itself to the audience, and we roared at one
another loud and long.</p>

<p>The President has sent to me twice, and I am going to
see him to-morrow. He has a whole row for his family
every night. Dolby rejoined his chief yesterday morning,
and will probably remain in the august presence until
Sunday night. He and Osgood, "training for the match,"
are ludicrous beyond belief. I saw them just now coming
up a street, each trying to pass the other, and immediately
fled. Since I have been writing this, they have burst in at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the door and sat down on the floor to blow. Dolby is now
writing at a neighbouring table, with his bald head smoking
as if he were on fire. Kelly (his great adherent) asked me,
when he was last away, whether it was quite fair that I
should take Mr. Osgood out for "breathers" when Mr.
Dolby had no such advantage. I begin to expect that half
Boston will turn out on the 29th to see the match. In
which case it will be unspeakably droll.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>my Birthday</i>, 1868.</span><br />
(<i>And my cold worse than ever.</i>)<br />
</div>

<p>This will be but a short letter, as I have been to see the
President this morning, and have little time before the post
goes. He had sent a gentleman to me, most courteously
begging me to make my own appointment, and I did so. A
man of very remarkable appearance indeed, of tremendous
firmness of purpose. Not to be turned or trifled with.</p>

<p>As I mention my cold's being so bad, I will add that I
have never had anything the matter with me since I came
here <i>but</i> the cold. It is now in my throat, and slightly on
my chest. It occasions me great discomfort, and you would
suppose, seeing me in the morning, that I could not possibly
read at night. But I have always come up to the
scratch, have not yet missed one night, and have gradually
got used to that. I had got much the better of it; but the
dressing-room at the hall here is singularly cold and draughty,
and so I have slid back again.</p>

<p>The papers here having written about this being my
birthday, the most exquisite flowers came pouring in at
breakfast time from all sorts of people. The room is covered
with them, made up into beautiful bouquets, and arranged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in all manner of green baskets. Probably I shall find plenty
more at the hall to-night. This is considered the dullest
and most apathetic place in America. <i>My</i> audiences have
been superb.</p>

<p>I mentioned the dog on the first night here. Next night
I thought I heard (in "Copperfield") a suddenly suppressed
bark. It happened in this wise: Osgood, standing
just within the door, felt his leg touched, and looking down
beheld the dog staring intently at me, and evidently just
about to bark. In a transport of presence of mind and
fury, he instantly caught him up in both hands and threw
him over his own head out into the entry, where the check-takers
received him like a game at ball. Last night he came
again <i>with another dog;</i> but our people were so sharply on
the look-out for him that he didn't get in. He had
evidently promised to pass the other dog free.</p>

</div>

<p>The weather has been desperately severe, and my cold
quite as bad as ever. I couldn't help laughing at myself
on my birthday at Washington. It was observed as much
as though I were a little boy. Flowers and garlands (of
the most exquisite kind) bloomed all over the room; letters
radiant with good wishes poured in; a shirt pin, a handsome
silver travelling bottle, a set of gold shirt studs, and a
set of gold sleeve links were on the dinner-table. After
"Boots," at night, the whole audience rose and remained
(Secretaries of State, President's family, Judges of Supreme
Court, and so forth) standing and cheering until I went
back to the table and made them a little speech. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
same august day of the year I was received by the President,
a man with a very remarkable and determined face. Each
of us looked at each other very hard, and each of us
managed the interview (I think) to the satisfaction of the
other. In the outer room was sitting a certain sunburnt
General Blair, with many evidences of the war upon him.
He got up to shake hands with me, and then I found he
had been out in the prairie with me five-and-twenty years
ago. That afternoon my "catarrh" was in such a state
that Charles Sumner, coming in at five o'clock and finding
me covered with mustard poultice, and apparently voiceless,
turned to Dolby and said: "Surely, Mr. Dolby, it is impossible
that he can read to-night." Says Dolby: "Sir, I have
told the dear Chief so four times to-day, and I have been
very anxious. But you have no idea how he will change when
he gets to the little table." After five minutes of the little
table, I was not (for the time) even hoarse. The frequent
experience of this return of force when it is wanted saves
me a vast amount of anxiety.</p>

<p>I wish you would get from Homan and report to me, as
near as he can make, an approximate estimate is the right
term in the trade, I believe, of the following work:</p>

<p>1. To re-cover, with red leather, all the dining-room
chairs.</p>

<p>2. To ditto, with green leather, all the library chairs
and the couch.</p>

<p>3. To provide and lay down new <i>Brussels</i> carpets in
the front spare and the two top spares. Quality of carpet,
quality of yours and mine.</p>

<p>I have some doubts about the state of the hall floor-cloth,
and also the floor-cloth in the dining-room. Will you
and your aunt carefully examine both (calling in Homan
too, if necessary), <i>and report to me?</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that "No Thoroughfare" has really
developed as a drama into an amazing success. I begin to
think that I shall see it. Dolby is away this morning, to
conquer or die in a terrific struggle with the Mayor of
Newhaven (where I am to read next week), who has assailed
him on a charge of false play in selling tickets. Osgood,
my other keeper, stands at the table to take me out,
and have a "breather" for the walking-match, so I must
leave off.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Harry</span>,</div>

<p>I should have written to you before now, but for
constant and arduous occupation.</p>

<p>In reference to the cricket club's not being what it
might be, I agree with you in the main. There are some
things to be considered, however, which you have hardly
taken into account. The first thing to be avoided is, the
slightest appearance of patronage (one of the curses of
England). The second thing to be avoided is, the deprival
of the men of their just right to manage their own affairs.
I would rather have no club at all, than have either of these
great mistakes made. The way out of them is this: Call
the men together, and explain to them that the club might
be larger, richer, and better. Say that you think that more
of the neighbouring gentlemen could be got to be playing
members. That you submit to them that it would be
better to have a captain who could correspond with them,
and talk to them, and in some sort manage them; and that,
being perfectly acquainted with the game, and having long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
played it at a great public school, you propose yourself as
captain, for the foregoing reasons. That you propose to
them to make the subscription of the gentlemen members
at least double that of the working men, for no other reason
than that the gentlemen can afford it better; but that both
classes of members shall have exactly the same right of
voting equally in all that concerns the club. Say that
you have consulted me upon the matter, and that I am
of these opinions, and am ready to become chairman of
the club, and to preside at their meetings, and to overlook
its business affairs, and to give it five pounds a
year, payable at the commencement of each season. Then,
having brought them to this point, draw up the club's
rules and regulations, amending them where they want
amendment.</p>

<p>Discreetly done, I see no difficulty in this. But it can
only be honourably and hopefully done by having the men
together. And I would not have them at The Falstaff, but
in the hall or dining-room&mdash;the servants' hall, an excellent
place. Whatever you do, let the men ratify; and let them
feel their little importance, and at once perceive how much
better the business begins to be done.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear of the success of your reading,
and still more glad that you went at it in downright earnest.
I should never have made my success in life if I had been
shy of taking pains, or if I had not bestowed upon the
least thing I have ever undertaken exactly the same
attention and care that I have bestowed upon the greatest.
Do everything at your best. It was but this last year
that I set to and learned every word of my readings; and
from ten years ago to last night, I have never read to an
audience but I have watched for an opportunity of striking
out something better somewhere. Look at such of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
manuscripts as are in the library at Gad's, and think of the

<p>The weather is very severe here, and the work is very
hard. Dolby, having been violently pitched into by the
Mayor of Newhaven (a town at which I am to read next
week), has gone bodily this morning with defiant written
instructions from me to inform the said mayor that, if he fail
to make out his case, he (Dolby) is to return all the money
taken, and to tell him that I will not set foot in his jurisdiction;
whereupon the Newhaven people will probably
fall upon the mayor in his turn, and lead him a pleasant
life.</p>

<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>Thursday, Feb. 13th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>We have got into an immense difficulty with the people
of Newhaven. I have a strong suspicion that one of our
men (who sold there) has been speculating all this while,
and that he must have put front seats in his pockets,
and sold back ones. He denies what the mayor charges,
but the mayor holds on grimly. Dolby set off from Baltimore
as soon as we found out what was amiss, to examine
and report; but some new feature of difficulty must have
come out, for this morning he telegraphs from New York
(where he had to sleep last night on his way to Newhaven),
that he is coming back for further consultation with the
Chief. It will certainly hurt us, and will of course be distorted
by the papers into all manner of shapes. My suspicion
<i>may not</i> be correct, but I have an instinctive belief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
that it is. We shall probably have the old New York row
(and loss) over again, unless I can catch this mayor tripping
in an assertion.</p>

<p>In this very place, we are half-distracted by the speculators.
They have been holding out for such high prices,
that the public have held out too; and now (frightened at
what they have done) the speculators are trying to sell their
worst seats at half the cost price, so that we are in the
ridiculous situation of having sold the room out, and yet not
knowing what empty seats there may be. <i>We</i> could sell at
our box-office to any extent; but <i>we</i> can't buy back of the
speculators, because we informed the public that all the
tickets were gone. And if we bought <i>under</i> our own price
and <i>sold</i> at our own price, we should at once be in treaty
with the speculators, and should be making money by it!
Dolby, the much bullied, will come back here presently, half
bereft of his senses; and I should be half bereft of mine, if
the situation were not comically disagreeable.</p>

<p>Nothing will induce the people to believe in the farewells.
At Baltimore on Tuesday night (a very brilliant night indeed),
they asked as they came out: "When will Mr. Dickens read
here again?" "Never." "Nonsense! Not come back,
after such houses as these? Come. Say when he'll read
again." Just the same here. We could as soon persuade
them that I am the President, as that I am going to read
here, for the last time, to-morrow night.</p>

<p>There is a child of the Barney Williams's in this house&mdash;a
little girl&mdash;to whom I presented a black doll when I was
here last. I have seen her eye at the keyhole since I began
writing this, and I think she and the doll are outside still.
"When you sent it up to me by the coloured boy," she said
after receiving it (coloured boy is the term for black waiter),
"I gave such a cream that ma came running in and creamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
too, 'cos she fort I'd hurt myself. But I creamed a cream
of joy." <i>She</i> had a friend to play with her that day, and
brought the friend with her, to my infinite confusion. A
friend all stockings, and much too tall, who sat on the sofa
very far back, with her stockings sticking stiffly out in front
of her, and glared at me and never spake word. Dolby
found us confronted in a sort of fascination, like serpent and
bird.</p>

<p>I got your letter of the 3rd of February here this
morning. As I am off at seven to-morrow morning, I
answer it at once, though indeed I have nothing to say.</p>

<p>"True American" still sticking to me. But I am always
ready for my work, and therefore don't much mind. Dolby
and the Mayor of Newhaven alternately embrace and exchange
mortal defiances. In writing out some advertisements
towards midnight last night, he made a very good
mistake. "The reading will be comprised within two
<i>minutes</i>, and the audience are earnestly entreated to be
seated ten <i>hours</i> before its commencement."</p>

<p>The weather has been finer lately, but the streets are in
a horrible condition, through half-melted snow, and it is
now snowing again. The walking-match (next Saturday
week) is already in the Boston papers! I suppose half
Boston will turn out on the occasion. As a sure way of not
being conspicuous, "the men" are going to walk in flannel!
They are in a mingled state of comicality and gravity about
it that is highly ridiculous. Yesterday being a bright cool
day, I took Dolby for a "buster" of eight miles. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
everybody here knows me, the spectacle of our splitting up
the fashionable avenue (the only way out of town) excited
the greatest amazement. No doubt <i>that</i> will be in the
papers to-morrow. I give a gorgeous banquet to eighteen
(ladies and gentlemen) after the match. Mr. and Mrs.
Fields, Do. Ticknor, Longfellow and his daughter, Lowell,
Holmes and his wife, etc. etc. Sporting speeches to be
made, and the stakes (four hats) to be handed over to the
winner.</p>

<p>My ship will not be the <i>Cuba</i> after all. She is to go
into dock, and the <i>Russia</i> (a larger ship, and the latest built
for the Cunard line) is to take her place.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fechter</span>,</div>

<p>Your letter reached me here yesterday. I have sent
you a telegram (addressed to the theatre) this morning, and
I write this by the earliest return mail.</p>

<p>My dear fellow, consider yourself my representative.
Whatever you do, or desire to do, about the play, I fully
authorise beforehand. Tell Webster, with my regard, that
I think his proposal honest and fair; that I think it, in a
word, like himself; and that I have perfect confidence in
his good faith and liberality.</p>

<p>As to making money of the play in the United States
here, Boucicault has filled Wilkie's head with golden dreams
that have <i>nothing</i> in them. He makes no account of the
fact that, wherever I go, the theatres (with my name in big
letters) instantly begin playing versions of my books, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that the moment the Christmas number came over here they
pirated it and played "No Thoroughfare." Now, I have
enquired into the law, and am extremely doubtful whether
I <i>could</i> have prevented this. Why should they pay for the
piece as you act it, when they have no actors, and when
all they want is my name, and they can get that for
nothing?</p>

<p>Wilkie has uniformly written of you enthusiastically.
In a letter I had from him, dated the 10th of January, he
described your conception and execution of the part in
the most glowing terms. "Here Fechter is magnificent."
"Here his superb playing brings the house down." "I
should call even his exit in the last act one of the subtlest
and finest things he does in the piece." "You can hardly
imagine what he gets out of the part, or what he makes of
his passionate love for Marguerite." These expressions,
and many others like them, crowded his letter.</p>

<p>I never did so want to see a character played on the
stage as I want to see you play Obenreizer. As the play
was going when I last heard of it, I have some hopes that I
<span class="smcap">may</span> see it yet. Please God, your Adelphi dressing-room
will be irradiated with the noble presence of "Never
Wrong" (if you are acting), about the evening of Monday,
the 4th of May!</p>

<p>I am doing enormous business. It is a wearying life,
away from all I love, but I hope that the time will soon
begin to spin away. Among the many changes that I find
here is the comfortable change that the people are in
general extremely considerate, and very observant of my
privacy. Even in this place, I am really almost as much
my own master as if I were in an English country town.
Generally, they are very good audiences indeed. They do
not (I think) perceive touches of art to <i>be</i> art; but they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
responsive to the broad results of such touches. "Doctor
Marigold" is a great favourite, and they laugh so unrestrainedly
at "The Trial" from "Pickwick" (which you never
heard), that it has grown about half as long again as it used
to be.</p>

<p>If I could send you a "brandy cocktail" by post I
would. It is a highly meritorious dram, which I hope to
present to you at Gad's. My New York landlord made me
a "Rocky Mountain sneezer," which appeared to me to
be compounded of all the spirits ever heard of in the
world, with bitters, lemon, sugar, and snow. You can
only make a true "sneezer" when the snow is lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>There, my dear boy, my paper is out, and I am going to
read "Copperfield." Count always on my fidelity and true
attachment, and look out, as I have already said, for a
distinguished visitor about Monday, the 4th of May.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<p>It is so very difficult to know, by any exercise of
common sense, what turn or height the political excitement
may take next, and it may so easily, and so soon, swallow
up all other things, that I think I shall suppress my next
week's readings here (by good fortune not yet announced)
and watch the course of events. Dolby's sudden desponding
under these circumstances is so acute, that it is
actually swelling his head as I glance at him in the glass
while writing.</p>

<p>The catarrh is no better and no worse. The weather is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
intensely cold. The walking-match (of which I will send
particulars) is to come off on Sunday. Mrs. Fields is more
delightful than ever, and Fields more hospitable. My
room is always radiant with brilliant flowers of their sending.
I don't know whether I told you that the walking-match
is to celebrate the extinction of February, and the
coming of the day when I can say "next month."</p>

<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>Thursday, Feb. 27th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>This morning at breakfast I received yours of the 11th
from Palace Gate House. I have very little news to give
you in return for your budget. The walking-match is to
come off on Saturday, and Fields and I went over the
ground yesterday to measure the miles. We went at a
tremendous pace. The condition of the ground is something
indescribable, from half-melted snow, running water,
and sheets and blocks of ice. The two performers have
not the faintest notion of the weight of the task they
have undertaken. I give a dinner afterwards, and have
just now been settling the bill of fare and selecting the
wines.</p>

<p>In the first excitement of the presidential impeachment,
our houses instantly went down. After carefully considering
the subject, I decided to take advantage of the fact that
next week's four readings here have not yet been announced,
and to abolish them altogether. Nothing in this country
lasts long, and I think the public may be heartily tired of
the President's name by the 9th of March, when I read at
a considerable distance from here. So behold me with a
whole week's holiday in view! The Boston audiences have
come to regard the readings and the reader as their peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
property; and you would be at once amused and pleased if
you could see the curious way in which they seem to plume
themselves on both. They have taken to applauding too
whenever they laugh or cry, and the result is very inspiriting.
I shall remain here until Saturday, the 7th, but shall
not read here, after to-morrow night, until the 1st of April,
when I begin my Boston farewells, six in number.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Friday, 28th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>It has been snowing all night, and the city is in a
miserable condition. We had a fine house last night for
"Carol" and "Trial," and such an enthusiastic one that
they persisted in a call after the "Carol," and, while I was out,
covered the little table with flowers. The "True American"
has taken a fresh start, as if it were quite a novelty, and is
on the whole rather worse than ever to-day. The Cunard
packet, the <i>Australasian</i> (a poor ship), is some days overdue,
and Dolby is anxiously looking out for her. There is a lull
in the excitement about the President, but the articles of
impeachment are to be produced this afternoon, and then it
may set in again. Osgood came into camp last night from
selling in remote places, and reports that at Rochester and
Buffalo (both places near the frontier), Canada people
bought tickets, who had struggled across the frozen river
and clambered over all sorts of obstructions to get them.
Some of those halls turn out to be smaller than represented,
but I have no doubt, to use an American expression, that we
shall "get along."</p>

<p>To-morrow fortnight we purpose being at the Falls of
Niagara, and then we shall turn back and really begin to
wind up. I have got to know the "Carol" so well that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
can't remember it, and occasionally go dodging about in
the wildest manner to pick up lost pieces. They took it
so tremendously last night that I was stopped every five
minutes. One poor young girl in mourning burst into a
passion of grief about Tiny Tim, and was taken out. This
is all my news.</p>

<p>Each of the pedestrians is endeavouring to persuade
the other to take something unwholesome before starting.</p>

<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>Monday, March 2nd, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A heavy gale of wind and a snowstorm oblige me to
write suddenly for the Cunard steamer a day earlier than
usual. The railroad between this and New York will
probably be stopped somewhere. After all the hard weather
we have had, this is the worst day we have seen.</p>

<p>The walking-match came off on Saturday, over tremendously
difficult ground, against a biting wind, and
through deep snow-wreaths. It was so cold, too, that our
hair, beards, eyelashes, eyebrows, were frozen hard, and
hung with icicles. The course was thirteen miles. They
were close together at the turning-point, when Osgood went
ahead at a splitting pace and with extraordinary endurance,
and won by half a mile. Dolby did very well indeed, and
begs that he may not be despised. In the evening I gave a
very splendid dinner. Eighteen covers, most magnificent
flowers, such table decoration as was never seen in these
parts. The whole thing was a great success, and everybody
was delighted.</p>

<p>I am holiday-making until Friday, when we start on the
round of travel that is to bring us back here for the 1st of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
April. My holiday-making is simply thorough resting,
except on Wednesday, when I dine with Longfellow. There
is still great political excitement, but I hope it may not hurt
us very much. My fear is that it may damage the farewell.
Dolby is not of my mind as to this, and I hope he may be
right. We are not quite determined whether Mrs. Fields
did not desert our colours, by coming on the ground in a
carriage, and having <i>bread soaked in brandy</i> put into the
winning man's mouth as he steamed along. She pleaded
that she would have done as much for Dolby, if <i>he</i> had been
ahead, so we are inclined to forgive her. As she had done
so much for me in the way of flowers, I thought I would
show her a sight in that line at the dinner. You never saw
anything like it. Two immense crowns; the base, of the
choicest exotics; and the loops, oval masses of violets. In
the centre of the table an immense basket, overflowing
with enormous bell-mouthed lilies; all round the table a
bright green border of wreathed creeper, with clustering
roses at intervals; a rose for every button-hole, and a
bouquet for every lady. They made an exhibition of the
table before dinner to numbers of people.</p>

<p>P. H. has just come in with a newspaper, containing a
reference (in good taste!) to the walking-match. He posts
it to you by this post.</p>

<p>It is telegraphed that the storm prevails over an immense
extent of country, and is just the same at Chicago as here.
I hope it may prove a wind-up. We are getting sick of the
sound of sleigh-bells even.</p>

<p>Your account of Anne has greatly interested me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<i>Sunday Night, March 8th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fechter</span>,</div>

<p>I am here in a most wonderful out-of-the-world place,
which looks as if it had begun to be built yesterday, and
were going to be imperfectly knocked together with a nail
or two the day after to-morrow. I am in the worst inn
that ever was seen, and outside is a thaw that places the
whole country under water. I have looked out of window
for the people, and I can't find any people. I have tried
all the wines in the house, and there are only two wines, for
which you pay six shillings a bottle, or fifteen, according as
you feel disposed to change the name of the thing you ask
for. (The article never changes.) The bill of fare is "in
French," and the principal article (the carte is printed) is
"Paettie de shay." I asked the Irish waiter what this dish
was, and he said: "It was the name the steward giv' to
oyster patties&mdash;the Frinch name." These are the drinks
you are to wash it down with: "Mooseux," "Abasinthe,"
"Curacco," "Marschine," "Annise," and "Margeaux"!</p>

<p>I am growing very home-sick, and very anxious for the
22nd of April; on which day, please God, I embark for
home. I am beginning to be tired, and have been depressed
all the time (except when reading), and have lost my appetite.
I cannot tell you&mdash;but you know, and therefore why should
I?&mdash;how overjoyed I shall be to see you again, my dear boy,
and how sorely I miss a dear friend, and how sorely I miss
all art, in these parts. No disparagement to the country,
which has a great future in reserve, or to its people, who
are very kind to me.</p>

<p>I mean to take my leave of readings in the autumn and
winter, in a final series in England with Chappell. This
will come into the way of literary work for a time, for, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
I have rested&mdash;don't laugh&mdash;it is a grim reality&mdash;I shall
have to turn my mind to&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;to&mdash;ha! ha!
ha! (more sepulchrally than before)&mdash;the&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Christmas
Number</span>!!! I feel as if I had murdered a Christmas
number years ago (perhaps I did!) and its ghost perpetually
haunted me. Nevertheless in some blessed rest at Gad's,
we will talk over stage matters, and all matters, in an even
way, and see what we can make of them, please God. Be
sure that I shall not be in London one evening, after disembarking,
without coming round to the theatre to embrace
you, my dear fellow.</p>

<p>I have had an American cold (the worst in the world)
since Christmas Day. I read four times a week, with the
most tremendous energy I can bring to bear upon it. I
travel about pretty heavily. I am very resolute about
calling on people, or receiving people, or dining out, and so
save myself a great deal. I read in all sorts of places&mdash;churches,
theatres, concert rooms, lecture halls. Every
night I read I am described (mostly by people who have
not the faintest notion of observing) from the sole of my
boot to where the topmost hair of my head ought to be,
but is not. Sometimes I am described as being "evidently
nervous;" sometimes it is rather taken ill that "Mr.
Dickens is so extraordinarily composed." My eyes are
blue, red, grey, white, green, brown, black, hazel, violet,
and rainbow-coloured. I am like "a well-to-do American
gentleman," and the Emperor of the French, with an occasional
touch of the Emperor of China, and a deterioration
from the attributes of our famous townsman, Rufus W. B. D.
Dodge Grumsher Pickville. I say all sorts of things that I
never said, go to all sorts of places that I never saw or
heard of, and have done all manner of things (in some previous
state of existence I suppose) that have quite escaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
my memory. You ask your friend to describe what he is
about. This is what he is about, every day and hour of his
American life.</p>

<p>I hope to be back with you before you write to me!</p>

<p>As we shall probably be busy all day to-morrow, I
write this to-day, though it will not leave New York until
Wednesday. This is a very grim place in a heavy thaw,
and a most depressing one. The hotel also is surprisingly
bad, quite a triumph in that way. We stood out for an
hour in the melting snow, and came in again, having to
change completely. Then we sat down by the stove (no
fireplace), and there we are now. We were so afraid to go
to bed last night, the rooms were so close and sour, that
we played whist, double dummy, till we couldn't bear each
other any longer. We had an old buffalo for supper, and
an old pig for breakfast, and we are going to have I
don't know what for dinner at six. In the public rooms
downstairs, a number of men (speechless) are sitting in
rocking-chairs, with their feet against the window-frames,
staring out at window and spitting dolefully at intervals.
Scott is in tears, and George the gasman is suborning
people to go and clean the hall, which is a marvel of dirt.
And yet we have taken considerably over three hundred
pounds for to-morrow night!</p>

<p>We were at Albany the night before last and yesterday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
morning; a very pretty town, where I am to read on the
18th and 19th. This day week we hope to wash out this
establishment with the Falls of Niagara. And there is my
news, except that your <i>last letters</i> to me in America must
be posted by the Cunard steamer, which will sail from
Liverpool on <i>Saturday, the 4th of April</i>. These I shall be
safe to get before embarking.</p>

<p>I send a note to Katie (addressed to Mamie) by this
mail. I wrote to Harry some weeks ago, stating to him on
what principles he must act in remodelling the cricket
club, if he would secure success.</p>

<i>Monday Morning, 9th.</i><br />

<p>Nothing new. Weather cloudy, and town more dismal
than yesterday. It froze again last night, and thaws again
this morning. Somebody sent me an Australian newspaper
this morning&mdash;some citizen of Syracuse I mean&mdash;because of
a paragraph in it describing the taking of two freebooters,
at which taking Alfred was present. Though I do not
make out that he had anything in the world to do with it,
except having his name pressed into the service of the
newspaper.</p>

<span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, <i>Thursday, March 12th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I hope this may be in time for next Saturday's mail;
but this is a long way from New York, and rivers are
swollen with melted snow, and travelling is unusually
slow.</p>

<p>Just now (two o'clock in the afternoon) I received your
sad news of the death of poor dear Chauncey.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
goes to my heart. It is not a light thing to lose such a
friend, and I truly loved him. In the first unreasonable
train of feeling, I dwelt more than I should have thought
possible on my being unable to attend his funeral. I
know how little this really matters; but I know he would
have wished me to be there with real honest tears for his
memory, and I feel it very much. I never, never, never
was better loved by man than I was by him, I am sure.
Poor dear fellow, good affectionate gentle creature.</p>

<p>I have not as yet received any letter from Henri, nor do
I think he can have written to New York by your mail.
I believe that I am&mdash;I know that I <i>was</i>&mdash;one of the executors.
In that case Mr. Jackson, his agent, will either
write to me very shortly on Henri's information of my
address, or enquiry will be made at Gad's or at the office
about it.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to write more just now. The news
is a real shock at such a distance, and I must read to-night,
and I must compose my mind. Let Mekitty know that I
received her violets with great pleasure, and that I sent her
my best love and my best thanks.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February I read "Copperfield" and
"Bob" at Boston. Either on that very day, or very close
upon it, I was describing his (Townshend's) house to Fields,
and telling him about the great Danby picture that he
should see when he came to London.</p>

<p>I found yours of the 28th February, when I came back
here last night. We have had two brilliant sunny days at
Niagara, and have seen that wonderful place under the finest
circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Enclosed I return you Homan's estimate; let all that
work be done, including the curtains.</p>

<p>As to the hall, I have my doubts whether one of the
parqueted floors made by Aaron Smith's, of Bond Street,
ought not to be better than tiles, for the reason that perhaps
the nature of the house's construction might render the
"bed" necessary for wooden flooring more easy to be made
than the "bed" necessary for tiles. I don't think you can
do better than call in the trusty Lillie to advise. Decide with
your aunt on which appears to be better, under the circumstances.
Have estimate made for <i>cash</i>, select patterns and
colours, and let the work be done out of hand. (Here's a
prompt order; now I draw breath.) Let it be thoroughly
well done&mdash;no half measures.</p>

<p>There is a great thaw all over the country here, and I
think it has done the catarrh good. I am to read at the
famous Newhaven on Tuesday, the 24th. I hope without
a row, but cannot say. The readings are running out fast
now, and we are growing very restless.</p>

<p>This is a short letter, but we are pressed for time. It is
two o'clock, and we dine at three, before reading. To-morrow
we rise at six, and have eleven hours' railway
or so. We have now come back from our farthest point,
and are steadily working towards home.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Macready</span>,</div>

<p>What with perpetual reading and travelling, what
with a "true American catarrh" (on which I am complimented
almost boastfully), and what with one of the severest
winters ever known, your coals of fire received by the last
mail did not burn my head so much as they might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
done under less excusatory circumstances. But they
scorched it too!</p>

<p>You would find the general aspect of America and
Americans decidedly much improved. You would find
immeasurably greater consideration and respect for your
privacy than of old. You would find a steady change for
the better everywhere, except (oddly enough) in the railroads
generally, which seem to have stood still, while
everything else has moved. But there is an exception
westward. There the express trains have now a very
delightful carriage called a "drawing-room car," literally
a series of little private drawing-rooms, with sofas and
a table in each, opening out of a little corridor. In each,
too, is a large plate-glass window, with which you can do as
you like. As you pay extra for this luxury, it may be regarded
as the first move towards two classes of passengers.
When the railroad straight away to San Francisco (in six
days) shall be opened through, it will not only have these
drawing-rooms, but sleeping-rooms too; a bell in every
little apartment communicating with a steward's pantry, a
restaurant, a staff of servants, marble washing-stands, and
a barber's shop! I looked into one of these cars a day or
two ago, and it was very ingeniously arranged and quite
complete.</p>

<p>I left Niagara last Sunday, and travelled on to Albany,
through three hundred miles of flood, villages deserted,
bridges broken, fences drifting away, nothing but tearing
water, floating ice, and absolute wreck and ruin. The train
gave in altogether at Utica, and the passengers were let
loose there for the night. As I was due at Albany, a very
active superintendent of works did all he could to "get
Mr. Dickens along," and in the morning we resumed our
journey through the water, with a hundred men in seven-league<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
boots pushing the ice from before us with long poles.
How we got to Albany I can't say, but we got there somehow,
just in time for a triumphal "Carol" and "Trial."
All the tickets had been sold, and we found the Albanians
in a state of great excitement. You may imagine what the
flood was when I tell you that we took the passengers out
of two trains that had their fires put out by the water four-and-twenty
hours before, and cattle from trucks that had
been in the water I don't know how long, but so long that
the sheep had begun to eat each other! It was a horrible
spectacle, and the haggard human misery of their faces
was quite a new study. There was a fine breath of spring
in the air concurrently with the great thaw; but lo and
behold! last night it began to snow again with a strong
wind, and to-day a snowdrift covers this place with all the
desolation of winter once more. I never was so tired of
the sight of snow. As to sleighing, I have been sleighing
about to that extent, that I am sick of the sound of a
sleigh-bell.</p>

<p>I have seen all our Boston friends, except Curtis.
Ticknor is dead. The rest are very little changed, except
that Longfellow has a perfectly white flowing beard and
long white hair. But he does not otherwise look old, and
is infinitely handsomer than he was. I have been constantly
with them all, and they have always talked much of you.
It is the established joke that Boston is my "native place,"
and we hold all sorts of hearty foregatherings. They all
come to every reading, and are always in a most delightful
state of enthusiasm. They give me a parting dinner at the
club, on the Thursday before Good Friday. To pass from
Boston personal to New York theatrical, I will mention
here that one of the proprietors of my New York hotel is
one of the proprietors of Niblo's, and the most active.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Consequently I have seen the "Black Crook" and the
"White Fawn," in majesty, from an arm-chair in the first
entrance, P.S., more than once. Of these astonishing
dramas, I beg to report (seriously) that I have found no
human creature "behind" who has the slightest idea what
they are about (upon my honour, my dearest Macready!),
and that having some amiable small talk with a neat little
Spanish woman, who is the <i>premi&egrave;re danseuse</i>, I asked her,
in joke, to let me measure her skirt with my dress glove.
Holding the glove by the tip of the forefinger, I found the
skirt to be just three gloves long, and yet its length was
much in excess of the skirts of two hundred other ladies,
whom the carpenters were at that moment getting into their
places for a transformation scene, on revolving columns, on
wires and "travellers" in iron cradles, up in the flies, down
in the cellars, on every description of float that Wilmot,
gone distracted, could imagine!</p>

<p>I have taken my passage for Liverpool from New York
in the Cunarder <i>Russia</i>, on the 22nd of April. I had the
second officer's cabin on deck coming out, and I have the
chief steward's cabin on deck going home, because it will
be on the sunny side of the ship. I have experienced nothing
here but good humour and cordiality. In the autumn and
winter I have arranged with Chappells to take my farewell
of reading in the United Kingdom for ever and ever.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear of Benvenuta's marriage, and I
think her husband a very lucky man. Johnnie has my profound
sympathy under his examinatorial woes. The noble
boy will give me Gavazzi revised and enlarged, I expect,
when I next come to Cheltenham. I will give you and Mrs.
Macready all my American experiences when you come to
London, or, better still, to Gad's. Meanwhile I send my
hearty love to all, not forgetting dear Katie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Niagara is not at all spoiled by a very dizzy-looking
suspension bridge. Is to have another still nearer to the
Horse-shoe opened in July. My last sight of that scene
(last Sunday) was thus: We went up to the rapids above
the Horse-shoe&mdash;say two miles from it&mdash;and through the
great cloud of spray. Everything in the magnificent valley&mdash;buildings,
forest, high banks, air, water, everything&mdash;was
<i>made of rainbow</i>. Turner's most imaginative drawing in
his finest day has nothing in it so ethereal, so gorgeous in
fancy, so celestial. We said to one another (Dolby and I),
"Let it for evermore remain so," and shut our eyes and
came away.</p>

<p>God bless you and all dear to you, my dear old Friend!</p>

<p>I should have written to you by the last mail, but I
really was too unwell to do it. The writing day was last
Friday, when I ought to have left Boston for New Bedford
(fifty-five miles) before eleven in the morning. But I was
so exhausted that I could not be got up, and had to take
my chance of an evening's train producing me in time to
read, which it just did. With the return of snow, nine
days ago, the "true American" (which had lulled) came
back as bad as ever. I have coughed from two or three in
the morning until five or six, and have been absolutely
sleepless. I have had no appetite besides, and no taste.
Last night here I took some laudanum, and it is the only
thing that has done me good. But the life in this climate
is so very hard. When I did manage to get from Boston
to New Bedford, I read with my utmost force and vigour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Next morning, well or ill, I must turn out at seven to get
back to Boston on my way here.</p>

<p>I dine at Boston at three, and at five must come on here
(a hundred and thirty miles or so), for to-morrow night;
there being no Sunday train. To-morrow night I read here
in a very large place, and Tuesday morning at six I must
start again to get back to Boston once more. But after
to-morrow night, I have only the Boston and New York
farewells, thank God! I am most grateful to think that
when we came to devise the details of the tour, I foresaw
that it could never be done, as Dolby and Osgood proposed,
by one unassisted man, as if he were a machine. If I had
not cut out the work, and cut out Canada, I could never
have gone there, I am quite sure. Even as it is, I have just
now written to Dolby (who is in New York), to see my
doctor there, and ask him to send me some composing
medicine that I can take at night, inasmuch as without
sleep I cannot get through. However sympathetic and
devoted the people are about me, they <i>can not</i> be got to
comprehend that one's being able to do the two hours with
spirit when the time comes round, may be co-existent with
the consciousness of great depression and fatigue. I don't
mind saying all this, now that the labour is so nearly over.
You shall have a brighter account of me, please God, when
I close this at Boston.</p>

from New York. Catarrh rather better. Everything
triumphant last night, except no sleep again. I suppose
Dolby to be now on his way back to join me here. I am
much mistaken if the political crisis do not damage the
farewells by almost one half.</p>

<p>I hope that I am certainly better altogether.</p>

<p>I received your letter of from the 14th to the 17th of
March, here, last night. My New York doctor has prescribed
for me promptly, and I hope I am better. I am
certainly no worse. We shall do (to the best of my belief)
<i>very well</i> with the farewells here and at New York, but not
greatly. Everything is at a standstill, pending the impeachment
and the next presidential election. I forgot whether
I told you that the New York press are going to give me a
public dinner, on Saturday, the 18th.</p>

<p>I hear (but not from himself) that Wills has had a bad
fall in hunting, and is, or has been, laid up. I am supposed,
I take it, not to know this until I hear it from himself.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Thursday.</i><br />
</div>

<p>My notion of the farewells is pretty certain now to turn
out right. It is not at all probable that we shall do anything
enormous. Every pulpit in Massachusetts will resound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
to violent politics to-day and to-night. You remember the
Hutchinson family?<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I have had a grateful letter from John
Hutchinson. He speaks of "my sister Abby" as living in
New York. The immediate object of his note is to invite
me to the marriage of his daughter, twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p>You will see by the evidence of this piece of paper that
I am using up my stationery. Scott has just been making
anxious calculations as to our powers of holding out in the
articles of tooth-powder, etc. The calculations encourage
him to believe that we shall just hold out, and no more. I
think I am still better to-day than I was yesterday; but I
am far from strong, and have no appetite. To see me at
my little table at night, you would think me the freshest of
the fresh. And this is the marvel of Fields' life.</p>

<p>I don't forget that this is Forster's birthday.</p>

<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>Tuesday, April 7th, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I not only read last Friday, when I was doubtful of
being able to do so, but read as I never did before, and
astonished the audience quite as much as myself. You
never saw or heard such a scene of excitement.</p>

<p>Longfellow and all the Cambridge men urged me to
give in. I have been very near doing so, but feel stronger
to-day. I cannot tell whether the catarrh may have done
me any lasting injury in the lungs or other breathing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
organs, until I shall have rested and got home. I hope
and believe not. Consider the weather. There have been
two snowstorms since I wrote last, and to-day the town is
blotted out in a ceaseless whirl of snow and wind.</p>

<p>I cannot eat (to anything like the ordinary extent), and
have established this system: At seven in the morning, in
bed, a tumbler of new cream and two tablespoonsful of
rum. At twelve, a sherry cobbler and a biscuit. At three
(dinner time), a pint of champagne. At five minutes to
eight, an egg beaten up with a glass of sherry. Between
the parts, the strongest beef tea that can be made, drunk
hot. At a quarter-past ten, soup, and anything to drink
that I can fancy. I don't eat more than half a pound of
solid food in the whole four-and-twenty hours, if so much.</p>

<p>If I hold out, as I hope to do, I shall be greatly pressed
in leaving here and getting over to New York before next
Saturday's mail from there. Do not, therefore, <i>if all be well</i>,
expect to hear from me by Saturday's mail, but look for
my last letter from America by the mail of the following
Wednesday, the 15th. <i>Be sure</i> that you shall hear, however,
by Saturday's mail, if I should knock up as to reading. I
am tremendously "beat," but I feel really and unaffectedly
so much stronger to-day, both in my body and hopes, that
I am much encouraged. I have a fancy that I turned my
worst time last night.</p>

<p>Dolby is as tender as a woman and as watchful as a
doctor. He never leaves me during the reading now, but
sits at the side of the platform and keeps his eye upon me
all the time. Ditto George, the gasman, steadiest and most
reliable man I ever employed. I am the more hopeful of my
not having to relinquish a reading, because last night was
"Copperfield" and "Bob"&mdash;by a quarter of an hour the
longest, and, in consideration of the storm, by very much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the most trying. Yet I was far fresher afterwards than I
have been these three weeks.</p>

<p>I have "Dombey" to do to-night, and must go through
it carefully; so here ends my report. The personal affection
of the people in this place is charming to the last.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Watson</span>,</div>

<p>I am delighted to have your letter. It comes to me
like a faithful voice from dear old Rockingham, and awakens
many memories.</p>

<p>The work in America has been so very hard, and the winter
there has been so excessively severe, that I really have been
very unwell for some months. But I had not been at sea
three days on the passage home when I became myself
again.</p>

<p>If you will arrange with Mary Boyle any time for coming
here, we shall be charmed to see you, and I will adapt my
arrangements accordingly. I make this suggestion because
she generally comes here early in the summer season. But
if you will propose yourself <i>anyhow</i>, giving me a margin of
a few days in case of my being pre-engaged for this day or
that, we will (as my American friends say) "fix it."</p>

<p>What with travelling, reading night after night, and
speech-making day after day, I feel the peace of the country
beyond all expression. On board ship coming home, a
"deputation" (two in number, of whom only one could get
into my cabin, while the other looked in at my window)
came to ask me to read to the passengers that evening in
the saloon. I respectfully replied that sooner than do it, I
would assault the captain, and be put in irons.</p>

<p>On my return from America just now, I accidentally
heard that George had been ill. My sister-in-law had heard
it from Forster, but vaguely. Until I received your letter
of Wednesday's date, I had no idea that he had been very
ill; and should have been greatly shocked by knowing it,
were it not for the hopeful and bright assurance you give
me that he is greatly better.</p>

<p>My old affection for him has never cooled. The last
time he dined with me, I asked him to come again that day
ten years, for I was perfectly certain (this was my small
joke) that I should not set eyes upon him sooner. The
time being fully up, I hope you will remind him, with my
love, that he is due. His hand is upon these walls here, so
I should like him to see for himself, and <i>you</i> to see for
<i>yourself</i>, and in this hope I shall pursue his complete
recovery.</p>

<p>Since my return from America, I have been so overwhelmed
with business that I have not had time even to
write to you. You may imagine what six months of arrear
are to dispose of; added to this, Wills has received a concussion
of the brain (from an accident in the hunting-field),
and is sent away by the doctors, and strictly prohibited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
from even writing a note. Consequently all the business
and money details of "All the Year Round" devolve
upon me. And I have had to get them up, for I have never
had experience of them. Then I am suddenly entreated
to go to Paris, to look after the French version of "No
Thoroughfare" on the stage. And I go, and come back,
leaving it a great success.</p>

<p>I hope Mrs. Macready and you have not abandoned the
idea of coming here? The expression of this hope is the
principal, if not the only, object of this present note. May
the amiable secretary vouchsafe a satisfactory reply!</p>

<p>Katie, Mary, and Georgina send their very best love to
your Katie and Mrs. Macready. The undersigned is in his
usual brilliant condition, and indeed has greatly disappointed
them at home here, by coming back "so brown and looking

mortified. But they are getting over it now.</p>

I beg to be warmly remembered.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Letitia</span>,</div>

<p>You will have had a telegram from me to-day. I
received your sad news by this morning's post. They
never, without express explanation, mind "Immediate" on
a letter addressed to the office, because half the people who
write there on business that does not press, or on no business
at all, so mark their letters.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>
<p>On Thursday I have people to see and matters to attend
to, both at the office and at Coutts', which, in Wills's
absence, I cannot forego or depute to another. But,
<i>between ourselves</i>, I must add something else: I have the
greatest objection to attend a funeral in which my affections
are not strongly and immediately concerned. I have no
notion of a funeral as a matter of form or ceremony. And
just as I should expressly prohibit the summoning to my
own burial of anybody who was not very near or dear to me,
so I revolt from myself appearing at that solemn rite unless
the deceased were very near or dear to me. I cannot endure
being dressed up by an undertaker as part of his trade show.
I was not in this poor good fellow's house in his lifetime,
and I feel that I have no business there when he lies dead
in it. My mind is penetrated with sympathy and compassion
for the young widow, but that feeling is a real
thing, and my attendance as a mourner would not be&mdash;to
myself. It would be to you, I know, but it would not be to
myself. I know full well that you cannot delegate to me
your memories of and your associations with the deceased,
and the more true and tender they are the more invincible
is my objection to become a form in the midst of the most
awful realities.</p>

<p>With love and condolence from Georgina, Mary, and
Katie,</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wills</span>,</div>

<p>I had such a hard day at the office yesterday, that I
had not time to write to you before I left. So I write
to-day.</p>

<p>I am very unwilling to abandon the Christmas number,
though even in the case of my little Christmas books (which
were immensely profitable) I let the idea go when I thought
it was wearing out. Ever since I came home, I have hammered
at it, more or less, and have been uneasy about it. I
have begun something which is very droll, but it manifestly
shapes itself towards a book, and could not in the least admit
of even that shadowy approach to a congruous whole on the
part of other contributors which they have ever achieved at
the best. I have begun something else (aboard the American
mail-steamer); but I don't like it, because the stories must
come limping in after the old fashion, though, of course,
what I <i>have</i> done will be good for A. Y. R. In short, I
have cast about with the greatest pains and patience, and I
have been wholly unable to find what I want.</p>

<p>And yet I cannot quite make up my mind to give in without
another fight for it. I offered one hundred pounds reward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
at Gad's to anybody who could suggest a notion to satisfy
me. Charles Collins suggested one yesterday morning, in
which there is <i>something</i>, though not much. I will turn it
over and over, and try a few more starts on my own account.
Finally, I swear I will not give it up until August is out.
Vow registered.</p>

<p>I am clear that a number by "various writers" would
not do. If we have not the usual sort of number, we must
call the current number for that date the Christmas number,
and make it as good as possible.</p>

<p>I sit in the Ch&acirc;let,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> like Mariana in the Moated Grange,
and to as much purpose.</p>

<p>I am buying the freehold of the meadow at Gad's, and of
an adjoining arable field, so that I shall now have about eight-and-twenty
freehold acres in a ring-fence. No more now.</p>

<p>I made up a very good number yesterday. You will see
in it a very short article that I have called "Now!" which
is a highly remarkable piece of description. It is done by a
new man, from whom I have accepted another article; but
he will never do anything so good again.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>I was happy to receive your esteemed letter a few
days ago.</p>

<p>The severity of the winter in America (which was quite
exceptional even in that rigorous climate), combined with
the hard work I had to do, tried me a good deal. Neuralgia
and colds beset me, either by turns or both together, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
had often much to do to get through at night. But the sea
voyage home again did wonders in restoring me, and I
have been very well indeed, though a little fatigued, ever
since. I am now preparing for a final reading campaign in
England, Scotland, and Ireland. It will begin on the 6th
of October, and will probably last, with short occasional
intermissions, until June.</p>

<p>The great subject in England for the moment is the
horrible accident to the Irish mail-train. It is now supposed
that the petroleum (known to be a powerful an&aelig;sthetic)
rendered the unfortunate people who were burnt almost
instantly insensible to any sensation. My escape in the
Staplehurst accident of three years ago is not to be
obliterated from my nervous system. To this hour I have
sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a
hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite
insurmountable. I used to make nothing of driving a pair
of horses habitually through the most crowded parts of
London. I cannot now drive, with comfort to myself, on
the country roads here; and I doubt if I could ride at all
in the saddle. My reading secretary and companion knows
so well when one of these odd momentary seizures comes
upon me in a railway carriage, that he instantly produces
a dram of brandy, which rallies the blood to the heart and
generally prevails. I forget whether I ever told you that
my watch (a chronometer) has never gone exactly since the
accident? So the Irish catastrophe naturally revives the
dreadful things I saw that day.</p>

<p>The only other news here you know as well as I; to wit,
that the country is going to be ruined, and that the Church
is going to be ruined, and that both have become so used to
being ruined, that they will go on perfectly well.</p>

the railway carriage after leaving Higham station; but only
for a short time.</p>

not painfully. (Tell dear Georgy that I bought him his

<p>Poor Plorn is gone to Australia. It was a hard parting
at the last. He seemed to me to become once more my
youngest and favourite little child as the day drew near,
and I did not think I could have been so shaken. You
were his idol to the hour of his departure, and he asked me
to tell you how much he wanted to bid you good-bye.</p>

<p>I got your letter sent to Gad's Hill this morning.
Until I received it, I supposed the piece to have been put
into English from your French by young Ben. If I understand
that the English is yours, then I say that it is
extraordinarily good, written by one in another country.</p>

<p>I do not read again in London until the 20th; and then
"Copperfield." But by that time you will be at work

<p>We had a fine audience last night in the Free Trade
Hall, though not what we consider a large money-house.
The let in Liverpool is extremely good, and we are going
over there at half-past one. We got down here pleasantly
enough and in good time; so all has gone well you see.</p>

<p>Titiens, Santley, and an opera company of that class are
at the theatre here. They have been doing very poorly in
Manchester.</p>

<p>There is the whole of my scanty news. I was in wonderful
voice last night, but croak a little this morning, after
so much speaking in so very large a place. Otherwise I am
all right. I find myself constantly thinking of Plorn.</p>

<p>Our lets here are excellent, and we shall have a
great house to-night. We had a very fine and enthusiastic
audience in the Free Trade Hall, at Manchester, on
Saturday; but our first nights there never count up in
money, as the rest do. Yesterday, "Charlotte," Sainton,
and Piatti stayed with us here; and they went on to Hull
this morning. It was pleasant to be alone again, though
they were all very agreeable.</p>

<p>The exertion of going on for two hours in that immense
place at Manchester being very great, I was hoarse all day
yesterday, though I was not much distressed on Saturday
night. I am becoming melodious again (at three in the
afternoon) rapidly, and count on being quite restored by a
basin of turtle at dinner.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear about Armatage, and hope that a

well. I shall never be over-confident in such matters, I
think, any more.</p>

<p>We had a fine house here last night, and a large turn-away.

<p>I have your letter here this morning. I enclose you
another cheque for twenty-five pounds, and I write to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
London by this post, ordering three dozen sherry, two
dozen port, and three dozen light claret, to be sent down
to you.</p>

<p>Now, observe attentively. We must have no shadow of
debt. Square up everything whatsoever that it has been
necessary to buy. Let not a farthing be outstanding on
any account, when we begin together with your allowance.
Be particular in the minutest detail.</p>

<p>I wish to have no secret from you in the relations
we are to establish together, and I therefore send you Joe
Chitty's letter bodily. Reading it, you will know exactly
what I know, and will understand that I treat you with
perfect confidence. It appears to me that an allowance of
two hundred and fifty pounds a year will be handsome
for all your wants, if I send you your wines. I mean this
to include your tailor's bills as well as every other expense;
and I strongly recommend you to buy nothing in Cambridge,
and to take credit for nothing but the clothes with
which your tailor provides you. As soon as you have got
your furniture accounts in, let us wipe all those preliminary
expenses clean out, and I will then send you your first
quarter. We will count in it October, November, and
December; and your second quarter will begin with the
New Year. If you dislike, at first, taking charge of so
large a sum as sixty-two pounds ten shillings, you can have
your money from me half-quarterly.</p>

<p>You know how hard I work for what I get, and I think
you know that I never had money help from any human
creature after I was a child. You know that you are one
of many heavy charges on me, and that I trust to your so
exercising your abilities and improving the advantages of
your past expensive education, as soon to diminish <i>this</i>
charge. I say no more on that head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever you do, above all other things keep out of
debt and confide in me. If you ever find yourself on the
verge of any perplexity or difficulty, come to me. You will
never find me hard with you while you are manly and
truthful.</p>

<p>As your brothers have gone away one by one, I have
written to each of them what I am now going to write to
you. You know that you have never been hampered with
religious forms of restraint, and that with mere unmeaning
forms I have no sympathy. But I most strongly and
affectionately impress upon you the priceless value of the
New Testament, and the study of that book as the one
unfailing guide in life. Deeply respecting it, and bowing
down before the character of our Saviour, as separated
from the vain constructions and inventions of men, you
cannot go very wrong, and will always preserve at heart a
true spirit of veneration and humility. Similarly I impress
upon you the habit of saying a Christian prayer every night
and morning. These things have stood by me all through
my life, and remember that I tried to render the New
Testament intelligible to you and lovable by you when you
were a mere baby.</p>

<p>And so God bless you.</p>

The usual preparations are making for the band in the open

<p>We got down here to our time to the moment; and,
considering the length of the journey, very easily. I made
a calculation on the road, that the railway travelling over such
a distance involves something more than thirty thousand
shocks to the nerves. Dolby didn't like it at all.</p>

<p>The signals for a gale were up at Berwick, and along the
road between there and here. It came on just as we arrived,
and blew tremendously hard all night. The wind is still
very high, though the sky is bright and the sun shining.
We couldn't sleep for the noise.</p>

<p>We are very comfortably quartered. I fancy that the
"business" will be on the whole better here than in
Glasgow, where trade is said to be very bad. But I think
I shall be pretty correct in both places as to the run being
on the final readings.</p>

<p>I am hard at it here as usual, though with an
audience so finely perceptive that the labour is much diminished.
I have got together in a very short space the
conclusion of "Oliver Twist" that you suggested, and am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
trying it daily with the object of rising from that blank
state of horror into a fierce and passionate rush for the end.
As yet I cannot make a certain effect of it; but when I
shall have gone over it as many score of times as over the
rest of that reading, perhaps I may strike one out.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad to hear when you have done your
play, and I <i>am</i> glad to hear that you like the steamer. I
agree with you about the reading perfectly. In No. 3
you will see an exact account of some places I visited
at Ratcliffe. There are two little instances in it of something
comic rising up in the midst of the direst misery, that
struck me very humorously at the time.</p>

<p>As I have determined not to do the "Oliver Murder"
until after the 5th of January, when I shall ascertain its
effect on a great audience, it is curious to notice how the
shadow of its coming affects the Scotch mind. There was
such a disposition to hold back for it here (until I return
to finish in February) that we had next to no "let" when
we arrived. It all came with a rush yesterday. They gave
me a most magnificent welcome back from America last
night.</p>

<p>I am perpetually counting the weeks before me to be
"read" through, and am perpetually longing for the end of
them; and yet I sometimes wonder whether I shall miss
something when they are over.</p>

<p>It is a very, very bad day here, very dark and very wet.

<p>I send another <i>Scotsman</i> by this post, because it is
really a good newspaper, well written, and well managed.
We had an immense house here last night, and a very large
turn-away.</p>

<p>We have four guests to dinner to-day: Peter Fraser,
Ballantyne, John Blackwood, and Mr. Russel. Immense
preparations are making in the establishment, "on account,"
Mr. Kennedy says, "of a' four yon chiels being chiels wha'
ken a guid dinner." I enquired after poor Doctor Burt, not
having the least idea that he was dead.</p>

<p>My voice holds out splendidly so far, and I have had no
return of the American. But I sleep very indifferently indeed.</p>

<p>It blew appallingly here the night before last, but the
wind has since shifted northward, and it is now bright and
cold. The <i>Star of Hope</i>, that picked up those shipwrecked
people in the boat, came into Leith yesterday, and was
received with tremendous cheers. Her captain must be a
good man and a noble fellow.</p>

<p>The dinner-party of Saturday last was an immense
success. Russel swore on the occasion that he would go
over to Belfast expressly to dine with me at the Finlays'.
Ballantyne informed me that he was going to send you some
Scotch remembrance (I don't know what) at Christmas!</p>

<p>The Edinburgh houses are very fine. The Glasgow room
is a big wandering place, with five prices in it, which makes
it the more aggravating, as the people get into knots which
they can't break, as if they were afraid of one another.</p>

<p>Forgery of my name is becoming popular. You sent
me, this morning, a letter from Russell Sturgis, answering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
a supposed letter of mine (presented by "Miss Jefferies"),
and assuring me of his readiness to give not only the ten
pounds I asked for, but any contribution I wanted, towards
sending that lady and her family back to Boston.</p>

<p>I wish you would take an opportunity of forewarning
Lady Tennent that the first night's reading she will attend
is an experiment quite out of the way, and that she may
find it rather horrible.</p>

<p>The keeper of the Edinburgh Hall, a fine old soldier,
presented me, on Friday night, with the finest red camellia
for my button-hole that ever was seen. Nobody can
imagine how he came by it, as the florists had had a considerable
demand for that colour from ladies in the stalls,
and could get no such thing.</p>

<p>The day is dark, wet, and windy. The weather is likely
to be vile indeed at Glasgow, where it always rains, and
where the sun is never seen through the smoke. We go
over there to-morrow at ten.</p>

off that and "Bob" by ten minutes to ten.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about the Liverpool banquet,
except from <i>The Times</i>. As I don't finish there in February
(as they seem to have supposed), but in April, it may,
perhaps, stand over or blow over altogether. Such a thing

purposed making the journey. On my accepting the offer
he wrote again, saying that he had inspected "our Northern

<p>When your letter was delivered at "All the Year

comes to hand here consequently to-day.</p>

<p>I am diffident of addressing Mr. Gladstone on the subject
of your desire to be appointed to the vacant Commissionership
of Inland Revenue, because, although my
respect for him and confidence in him are second to those
of no man in England (a bold word at this time, but a
truthful one), my personal acquaintance with him is very
slight. But you may make, through any of your friends,
any use you please of this letter, towards the end of
bringing its contents under Mr. Gladstone's notice.</p>

<p>In expressing my conviction that you deserve the place,
and are in every way qualified for it, I found my testimony
upon as accurate a knowledge of your character and abilities
as anyone can possibly have acquired. In my editorship
both of "Household Words" and "All the Year Round,"
you know very well that I have invariably offered you those
subjects of political and social interest to write upon, in
which integrity, exactness, a remarkable power of generalising
evidence and balancing facts, and a special clearness in
stating the case, were indispensable on the part of the
writer. My confidence in your powers has never been
misplaced, and through all our literary intercourse you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
have never been hasty or wrong. Whatever trust you have
undertaken has been so completely discharged, that it has
become my habit to read your proofs rather for my own
edification than (as in other cases) for the detection of some
slip here or there, or the more pithy presentation of the
subject.</p>

<p>That your literary work has never interfered with the
discharge of your official duties, I may assume to be at least
as well known to your colleagues as it is to me. It is idle
to say that if the post were in my gift you should have it,
because you have had, for some years, most of the posts of
high trust that have been at my disposal. An excellent
public servant in your literary sphere of action, I should
be heartily glad if you could have this new opportunity of
distinguishing yourself in the same character. And this is
at least unselfish in me, for I suppose I should then lose
you?</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Plorn</span>,</div>

<p>I write this note to-day because your going away is
much upon my mind, and because I want you to have a few
parting words from me to think of now and then at quiet
times. I need not tell you that I love you dearly, and am
very, very sorry in my heart to part with you. But this
life is half made up of partings, and these pains must be
borne. It is my comfort and my sincere conviction that
you are going to try the life for which you are best fitted.
I think its freedom and wildness more suited to you than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
any experiment in a study or office would ever have been;
and without that training, you could have followed no
other suitable occupation.</p>

<p>What you have already wanted until now has been a
set, steady, constant purpose. I therefore exhort you to
persevere in a thorough determination to do whatever you
have to do as well as you can do it. I was not so old as
you are now when I first had to win my food, and do this
out of this determination, and I have never slackened in it
since.</p>

<p>Never take a mean advantage of anyone in any transaction,
and never be hard upon people who are in your
power. Try to do to others, as you would have them do to
you, and do not be discouraged if they fail sometimes. It
is much better for you that they should fail in obeying the
greatest rule laid down by our Saviour, than that you
should.</p>

<p>I put a New Testament among your books, for the very
same reasons, and with the very same hopes that made me
write an easy account of it for you, when you were a little
child; because it is the best book that ever was or will be
known in the world, and because it teaches you the best
lessons by which any human creature who tries to be
truthful and faithful to duty can possibly be guided. As
your brothers have gone away, one by one, I have written
to each such words as I am now writing to you, and have
entreated them all to guide themselves by this book, putting
aside the interpretations and inventions of men.</p>

<p>You will remember that you have never at home been
wearied about religious observances or mere formalities. I
have always been anxious not to weary my children with
such things before they are old enough to form opinions
respecting them. You will therefore understand the better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
that I now most solemnly impress upon you the truth and
beauty of the Christian religion, as it came from Christ Himself,
and the impossibility of your going far wrong if you
humbly but heartily respect it.</p>

<p>Only one thing more on this head. The more we are in
earnest as to feeling it, the less we are disposed to hold forth
about it. Never abandon the wholesome practice of saying
your own private prayers, night and morning. I have never
abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of it.</p>

<p>I hope you will always be able to say in after life, that
you had a kind father. You cannot show your affection for
him so well, or make him so happy, as by doing your duty.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> "Farewell Readings" in town and country were resumed
immediately after the beginning of this year, and
were to have been continued until the end of May. The
work was even harder than it had ever been. Charles
Dickens began his country tour in Ireland early in January,
and read continuously in all parts of England and Scotland
until the end of April. A public dinner (in commemoration
of his last readings in the town) was given to him at Liverpool
on the 10th April. Besides all this severe country
work, he was giving a series of readings at St. James's
Hall, and reading the "Murder" from "Oliver Twist," in
London and in the country, frequently four times a week.
In the second week of February, a sudden and unusually
violent attack of the old trouble in his foot made it imperatively
necessary to postpone a reading at St. James's Hall,
and to delay for a day or two his departure for Scotland.
The foot continued to cause him pain and inconvenience,
but, as will be seen from his letters, he generally spoke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
himself as otherwise well, until he arrived at Preston, where
he was to read on the 22nd of April. The day before this
appointed reading, he writes home of some grave symptoms
which he had observed in himself, and had reported to his
doctor, Mr. F. Carr Beard. That gentleman, taking alarm
at what he considered "indisputable evidences of overwork,"
wisely resolved not to content himself with written consultations,
but went down to Preston on the day appointed for
the reading there, and, after seeing his patient, peremptorily
stopped it, carried him off to Liverpool, and the next
day to London. There he consulted Sir Thomas Watson,
who entirely corroborated Mr. Beard's opinion. And the
two doctors agreed that the course of readings must be
stopped for this year, and that reading, <i>combined with
travelling</i>, must be stopped <i>for ever</i>. Charles Dickens had
no alternative but to acquiesce in this verdict; but he felt
it keenly, not only for himself, but for the sake of the
Messrs. Chappell, who showed the most disinterested kindness
and solicitude on the occasion. He at once returned home
to Gad's Hill, and the rest and quiet of the country restored
him, for the time, to almost his usual condition of health
and spirits. But it was observed, by all who loved him,
that from this time forth he never regained his old vigour
and elasticity. The attack at Preston was the "beginning
of the end!"</div>

<p>During the spring and summer of this year, he received
visits from many dearly valued American friends. In May,
he stayed with his daughter and sister-in-law for two or
three weeks at the St. James's Hotel, Piccadilly, having
promised to be in London at the time of the arrival of Mr.
and Mrs. Fields, of Boston, who visited Europe, accompanied
by Miss Mabel Lowell (the daughter of the famous American
poet) this year. Besides these friends, Mr. and Mrs. Childs,
of Philadelphia&mdash;from whom he had received the greatest
kindness and hospitality, and for whom he had a hearty
regard&mdash;Dr. Fordyce Barker and his son, Mr. Eytinge (an
illustrator of an American edition of Charles Dickens's
works), and Mr. Bayard Taylor paid visits to Gad's Hill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
which were thoroughly enjoyed by Charles Dickens and his
family. This last summer was a very happy one. He had
the annual summer visitors and parties of his friends in the
neighbourhood. He was, as usual, projecting improvements
in his beloved country home; one, which he called the
"crowning improvement of all," was a large conservatory,
which was to be added during the absence of the family in
London in the following spring.</p>

<p>The state of Mr. Wills's health made it necessary for
him now to retire altogether from the editorship of "All
the Year Round." Charles Dickens's own letters express the
regret which he felt at the dissolution of this long and
always pleasant association. Mr. Wills's place at the
office was filled by Charles Dickens's eldest son, now sole
editor and proprietor of the journal.</p>

<p>In September Charles Dickens went to Birmingham,
accompanied by his son Harry, and presided at the opening
of the session of (what he calls in his letter to Mr. Arthur
Ryland, "<i>our</i> Institution") the Midland Institute. He
made a speech on education to the young students, and
promised to go back early in the following year and distribute
the prizes. In one of the letters which we give
to Mr. Ryland, he speaks of himself as "being in full force
again," and "going to finish his farewell readings soon after
Christmas." He had obtained the sanction of Sir Thomas
Watson to giving twelve readings, <i>in London only</i>, which he
had fixed for the beginning of the following year.</p>

<p>The letter to his friend Mr. Finlay, which opens the
year, was in reply to a proposal for a public banquet at
Belfast, projected by the Mayor of that town, and conveyed
through Mr. Finlay. This gentleman was at that time
proprietor of <i>The Northern Whig</i> newspaper at Belfast, and
he was son-in-law to Mr. Alexander Russel, editor of <i>The
Scotsman</i>.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens's letter this New Year to M. de Cerjat
was his last. That faithful and affectionate friend died very
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>To Miss Mary Boyle he writes to acknowledge a New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Year's gift, which he had been much touched by receiving
from her, at a time when he knew she was deeply afflicted
by the sudden death of her brother, Captain Cavendish
Boyle, for whom Charles Dickens had a true regard and
friendship.</p>

<p>While he was giving his series of London readings in
the spring, he received a numerously signed circular letter
from actors and actresses of the various London theatres.
They were very curious about his new reading of the "Oliver
Twist" murder, and representing to him the impossibility of
their attending an evening, requested him to give a morning
reading, for their especial benefit. We give his answer,
complying with the request. And the occasion was, to him,
a most gratifying and deeply interesting one.</p>

<p>The letter to Mr. Edmund Ollier was in answer to an
invitation to be present at the inauguration of a bust of
Mr. Leigh Hunt, which was to be placed over his grave at
Kensal Green.</p>

<p>The letter to Mr. Shirley Brooks, the well-known writer,
who succeeded Mr. Mark Lemon as editor of "Punch," and
for whom Charles Dickens had a cordial regard, was on the
subject of a memorial on behalf of Mrs. Peter Cunningham,
whose husband had recently died.</p>

<p>The "remarkable story," of which he writes to his
daughter in August, was called "An Experience." It was
written by a lady (who prefers to be anonymous) who had
been a contributor to "Household Words" from its first
starting, and was always highly valued in this capacity by
Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Our latest letters for this year are in October. One to
Mr. Charles Kent, sympathising with him on a disappointment
which he had experienced in a business undertaking,
and one to Mr. Macready, in which he tells him of his being
in the "preliminary agonies" of a new book. The first
number of "Edwin Drood" was to appear before the end
of his course of readings in March; and he was at work so
long beforehand with a view to sparing himself, and having
some numbers ready before the publication of the first one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>First my heartfelt wishes for many prosperous and
happy years. Next, as to the mayor's kind intentions. I
feel really grateful to him and gratified by the whole idea,
but acceptance of the distinction on my part would be impracticable.
My time in Ireland is all anticipated, and
I could not possibly prolong my stay, because I <i>must</i> be
back in London to read on Tuesday fortnight, and then
must immediately set forth for the West of England. It is
not likely, besides, that I shall get through these farewells
before the end of May. And the work is so hard, and my
voice is so precious, that I fear to add an ounce to the
fatigue, or I might be overweighted. The avoidance of
gas and crowds when I am not in the act of being cooked
before those lights of mine, is an essential part of the training
to which (as I think you know) I strictly adhere, and
although I have accepted the Liverpool invitation, I have
done so as an exception; the Liverpool people having always
treated me in our public relations with a kind of personal
affection.</p>

<p>I am sincerely anxious that the Mayor of Belfast should
know how the case stands with me. If you will kindly set
me straight and right, I shall be truly obliged to you.</p>

<p>My sister-in-law has been very unwell (though she is
now much better), and is recommended a brisk change. As
she is a good sailor, I mean to bring her to Ireland with me;
at which she is highly delighted.</p>

<i>Monday, Jan. 4th, 1869.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Cerjat</span>,</div>

<p>I will answer your question first. Have I done with
my farewell readings? Lord bless you, no; and I shall
think myself well out of it if I get done by the end of May.
I have undertaken one hundred and six, and have as yet
only vanquished twenty-eight. To-morrow night I read in
London for the first time the "Murder" from "Oliver Twist,"
which I have re-arranged for the purpose. Next day I start
for Dublin and Belfast. I am just back from Scotland for
a few Christmas holidays. I go back there next month;
and in the meantime and afterwards go everywhere else.</p>

<p>Take my guarantee for it, you may be quite comfortable
on the subject of papal aspirations and encroachments.
The English people are in unconquerable opposition to that
church. They have the animosity in the blood, derived
from the history of the past, though perhaps unconsciously.
But they do sincerely want to win Ireland over if they can.
They know that since the Union she has been hardly used.
They know that Scotland has <i>her</i> religion, and a very
uncomfortable one. They know that Scotland, though
intensely anti-papal, perceives it to be unjust that Ireland
has not <i>her</i> religion too, and has very emphatically declared
her opinion in the late elections. They know that a richly-endowed
church, forced upon a people who don't belong to
it, is a grievance with these people. They know that many
things, but especially an artfully and schemingly managed
institution like the Romish Church, thrive upon a grievance,
and that Rome has thriven exceedingly upon this, and made
the most of it. Lastly, the best among them know that
there is a gathering cloud in the West, considerably bigger
than a man's hand, under which a powerful Irish-American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
body, rich and active, is always drawing Ireland in that
direction; and that these are not times in which other
powers would back our holding Ireland by force, unless we
could make our claim good in proving fair and equal
government.</p>

<p>Poor Townshend charged me in his will "to publish
without alteration his religious opinions, which he sincerely
believed would tend to the happiness of mankind." To
publish them without alteration is absolutely impossible;
for they are distributed in the strangest fragments through
the strangest note-books, pocket-books, slips of paper and
what not, and produce a most incoherent and tautological
result. I infer that he must have held some always-postponed
idea of fitting them together. For these reasons I
would certainly publish nothing about them, if I had any
discretion in the matter. Having none, I suppose a book
must be made. His pictures and rings are gone to the
South Kensington Museum, and are now exhibiting there.</p>

<p>Charley Collins is no better and no worse. Katie looks
very young and very pretty. Her sister and Miss Hogarth
(my joint housekeepers) have been on duty this Christmas,
and have had enough to do. My boys are now all dispersed
in South America, India, and Australia, except Charley,
whom I have taken on at "All the Year Round" Office,
and Henry, who is an undergraduate at Trinity Hall, and
I hope will make his mark there. All well.</p>

<p>The Thames Embankment is (faults of ugliness in detail
apart) the finest public work yet done. From Westminster
Bridge to near Waterloo it is now lighted up at night, and
has a fine effect. They have begun to plant it with trees,
and the footway (not the road) is already open to the
Temple. Besides its beauty, and its usefulness in relieving
the crowded streets, it will greatly quicken and deepen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
what is learnedly called the "scour" of the river. But the
Corporation of London and some other nuisances have
brought the weirs above Twickenham into a very bare and
unsound condition, and they already begin to give and
vanish, as the stream runs faster and stronger.</p>

<p>Your undersigned friend has had a few occasional
reminders of his "true American catarrh." Although I
have exerted my voice very much, it has not yet been
once touched. In America I was obliged to patch it up
constantly.</p>

<p>I like to read your patriarchal account of yourself among
your Swiss vines and fig-trees. You wouldn't recognise
Gad's Hill now; I have so changed it, and bought land
about it. And yet I often think that if Mary were to marry
(which she won't) I should sell it and go genteelly vagabondising
over the face of the earth. Then indeed I might
see Lausanne again. But I don't seem in the way of it at
present, for the older I get, the more I do and the harder I
work.</p>

<p>I was more affected than you can easily believe, by
the sight of your gift lying on my dressing-table on the
morning of the new year. To be remembered in a friend's
heart when it is sore is a touching thing; and that and the
remembrance of the dead quite overpowered me, the one
being inseparable from the other.</p>

<p>You may be sure that I shall attach a special interest

<p>My preparations for a certain murder that I had to do
last night have rendered me unfit for letter-writing these
last few days, or you would have heard from me sooner.
The crime being completely off my mind and the blood
spilled, I am (like many of my fellow-criminals) in a highly
edifying state to-day.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Mamie</span>,</div>

<p>We have been doing immensely.</p>

<p>This place is most beautiful, though colder now than
one would expect. This hotel, an immense place, built
among picturesque broken rocks out in the blue sea, is
quite delicious. There are bright green trees in the garden,
and new peas a foot high. Our rooms are <i>en suite</i>, all
commanding the sea, and each with two very large plate-glass
windows. Everything good and well served.</p>

<p>A <i>pantomime</i> was being done last night, in the place
where I am to read to-night. It is something between a
theatre, a circus, a riding-school, a Methodist chapel, and a
cow-house. I was so disgusted with its acoustic properties
on going in to look at it, that the whole unfortunate staff
have been all day, and now are, sticking up baize and
carpets in it to prevent echoes.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen a more uncomfortable edifice than I
thought it last night.</p>

<p>At Clifton, on Monday night, we had a contagion of
fainting. And yet the place was not hot. I should think
we had from a dozen to twenty ladies borne out, stiff and
rigid, at various times. It became quite ridiculous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>You must not trust blank places in my list, because

"Uncommercial" in that week, and I also want to get poor
Chauncey's "opinions" to the printer.</p>

<p>Before getting your kind note, I had written to
Lehmann, explaining why I cannot allow myself any social
pleasure while my farewell task is yet unfinished. The
work is so very hard, that every little scrap of rest <i>and
silence</i> I can pick up is precious. And even those morsels
are so flavoured with "All the Year Round," that they are
not quite the genuine article.</p>

<p>Joachim<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> came round to see me at the hall last night,
and I told him how sorry I was to forego the pleasure of
meeting him (he is a noble fellow!) at your pleasant table.</p>

<p>I am glad you are coming to the "Murder" on the 2nd
of March. (The house will be prodigious.) Such little
changes as I have made shall be carefully presented to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
critical notice, and I hope will be crowned with your
approval. But you are always such a fine audience that I
have no fear on that head. I saw Chorley yesterday in his
own room. A sad and solitary sight. The widowed Drake,
with a certain <i>gin</i>coherence of manner, presented a blooming
countenance and buxom form in the passage; so buxom
indeed that she was obliged to retire before me like a
modest stopper, before I could get into the dining decanter
where poor Chorley reposed.</p>

<p>I received your letter at Edinburgh this morning. I
did not write to you yesterday, as there had been no reading
on the previous night.</p>

<p>The foot bears the fatigue wonderfully well, and really
occasions me no inconvenience beyond the necessity of
wearing the big work of art. Syme saw me again this
morning, and utterly scouted the gout notion altogether.
I think the Edinburgh audience understood the "Murder"
better last night than any audience that has heard it yet.
"Business" is enormous, and Dolby jubilant.</p>

<p>It is a most deplorable afternoon here, deplorable even
for Glasgow. A great wind blowing, and sleet driving
before it in a storm of heavy blobs. We had to drive our
train dead in the teeth of the wind, and got in here late,
and are pressed for time.</p>

<p>Strange that in the North we have had absolutely no
snow. There was a very thin scattering on the Pentlands
for an hour or two, but no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing to-morrow morning would be all but impracticable
for me; would be quite so for Dolby, who has to go
to the agents and "settle up" in the midst of his breakfast.
So I write to-day, in reply to your note received at
Glasgow this morning.</p>

<p>The foot conducts itself splendidly. We had a most
enormous cram at Glasgow. Syme saw me again yesterday
(before I left here for Glasgow), and repeated "Gout!"
with the greatest indignation and contempt, several times.
The aching is going off as the day goes on, if it be worth
mentioning again. The ride from Glasgow was charming
this morning; the sun shining brilliantly, and the country
looking beautiful.</p>

<p>I told you what the Nortons were. Mabel Lowell is a
charming little thing, and very retiring in manner and
expression.</p>

<p>We shall have a scene here to-night, no doubt. The
night before last, Ballantyne, unable to get in, had a seat
behind the screen, and was nearly frightened off it by the
"Murder." Every vestige of colour had left his face when I
came off, and he sat staring over a glass of champagne in
the wildest way. I have utterly left off <i>my</i> champagne, and,
I think, with good results. Nothing during the readings
but a very little weak iced brandy-and-water.</p>

<p>I hope you will find me greatly improved on Tuesday.</p>

<p>I have had my usual left boot on this morning, and have
had an hour's walk. It was in a gale of wind and a simoom
of dust, but I greatly enjoyed it. Immense enthusiasm at
Wolverhampton last night over "Marigold." Scott made a
most amazing ass of himself yesterday. He reported that he
had left behind somewhere three books&mdash;"Boots," "Murder,"
and "Gamp." We immediately telegraphed to the office.
Answer, no books there. As my impression was that he
must have left them at St. James's Hall, we then arranged
to send him up to London at seven this morning. Meanwhile
(though not reproached), he wept copiously and
audibly. I had asked him over and over again, was he sure
he had not put them in my large black trunk? Too sure,
too sure. Hadn't opened that trunk after Tuesday night's
reading. He opened it to get some clothes out when I
went to bed, and there the books were! He produced
them with an air of injured surprise, as if we had put
them there.</p>

<p>Tell Russell that a crop of hay is to be got off the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>

make such use of it last year as reconciles me to losing
another hay-crop. So they must wait until the hay is in,
before they commence active operations.</p>

<p>Poor Olliffe! I am truly sorry to read those sad words
about his suffering, and fear that the end is not far off.</p>

<p>We are very comfortably housed here, and certainly that
immense hall is a wonderful place for its size. Without
much greater expenditure of voice than usual, I a little
enlarged the action last night, and Dolby (who went to all
the distant points of view) reported that he could detect
no difference between it and any other place. As always
happens now&mdash;and did not at first&mdash;they were unanimously
taken by Noah Claypole's laugh. But the go, throughout,
was enormous. Sims Reeves was doing Henry Bertram at
the theatre, and of course took some of our shillings. It
was a night of excitement for Cottonopolis.</p>

I add a note of the days and subjects:</p>

and "Sikes and Nancy" from "Oliver Twist."</p>

<p>Saturday, May 8th. "The Christmas Carol."</p>

<p>Saturday, May 22nd. "Sikes and Nancy" from "Oliver

<span class="smcap">Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool</span>, <i>Sunday, April 4th, 1869.</i><br />
</div>

<p>By this post I send to Mary the truly affecting account
of poor dear Katie Macready's death. It is as sorrowful as
anything so peaceful and trustful can be!</p>

<p>Both my feet are very tender, and often feel as though
they were in hot water. But I was wonderfully well and
strong, thank God! and had no end of voice for the two
nights running in that great Birmingham hall. We had
enormous houses.</p>

<p>So far as I understand the dinner arrangements here,
they are much too long. As to the acoustics of that hall,
and the position of the tables (both as bad as bad can be),
my only consolation is that, if anybody can be heard, <i>I</i> probably
can be. The honorary secretary tells me that six
hundred people are to dine. The mayor, being no speaker
and out of health besides, hands over the toast of the evening
to Lord Dufferin. The town is full of the festival. The
Theatre Royal, touched up for the occasion, will look remarkably
bright and well for the readings, and our lets are large.
It is remarkable that our largest let as yet is for Thursday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
not Friday. I infer that the dinner damages Friday, but
Dolby does not think so. There appears to be great curiosity
to hear the "Murder." (On Friday night last I read to two
thousand people, and odd hundreds.)</p>

<p>I hear that Anthony Trollope, Dixon, Lord Houghton,
Lemon, Esquiros (of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>), and Sala
are to be called upon to speak; the last, for the newspaper
press. All the Liverpool notabilities are to muster. And
Manchester is to be represented by its mayor with due
formality.</p>

<p>I had been this morning to look at St. George's Hall,
and suggest what can be done to improve its acoustics. As
usually happens in such cases, their most important arrangements
are already made and unchangeable. I should not
have placed the tables in the committee's way at all, and
could certainly have placed the da&iuml;s to much greater advantage.
So all the good I could do was to show where banners
could be hung with some hope of stopping echoes. Such
is my small news, soon exhausted. We arrived here at three
yesterday afternoon; it is now mid-day; Chorley has not
yet appeared, but he had called at the local agent's while I
was at Birmingham.</p>

<p>It is a curious little instance of the way in which things
fit together that there is a ship-of-war in the Mersey, whose
flags and so forth are to be brought up to St. George's
Hall for the dinner. She is the <i>Donegal</i>, of which Paynter
told me he had just been captain, when he told me all
about Sydney at Bath.</p>

<p>One of the pleasantest things I have experienced here
this time, is the manner in which I am stopped in the streets
by working men, who want to shake hands with me, and tell
me they know my books. I never go out but this happens.
Down at the docks just now, a cooper with a fearful stutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
presented himself in this way. His modesty, combined
with a conviction that if he were in earnest I would see it
and wouldn't repel him, made up as true a piece of natural
politeness as I ever saw.</p>

<p>I send you this hasty line to let you know that I have
come to this sea-beach hotel (charming) for a day's rest. I
am much better than I was on Sunday, but shall want
careful looking to, to get through the readings. My weakness
and deadness are all <i>on the left side</i>, and if I don't
look at anything I try to touch with my left hand, I don't
know where it is. I am in (secret) consultation with Frank
Beard; he recognises, in the exact description I have given
him, indisputable evidences of overwork, which he would
wish to treat immediately. So I have said: "Go in and
win."</p>

<p>I have had a delicious walk by the sea to-day, and I
sleep soundly, and have picked up amazingly in appetite.
My foot is greatly better too, and I wear my own boot.</p>

<p>I have received your letter here to-day, and deeply
feel with you and for you the affliction of poor dear Katie's
loss. I was not unprepared for the sad news, but it comes
in such a rush of old remembrances and withered joys that
strikes to the heart.</p>

<p>God bless you! Love and youth are still beside you,
and in that thought I take comfort for my dear old friend.</p>

<p>I am happy to report myself perfectly well and flourishing.
We are just now announcing the resumption and conclusion
of the broken series of farewell readings in a London
course of twelve, beginning early in the new year.</p>

<p>Scarcely a day has gone by this summer in which we
have not talked of you and yours. Georgina, Mary, and I
continually speak of you. In the spirit we certainly are
even more together than we used to be in the body in the
old times. I don't know whether you have heard that
Harry has taken the second scholarship (fifty pounds a
year) at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. The bigwigs expect him
to do a good deal there.</p>

<p>Wills having given up in consequence of broken health
(he has been my sub-editor for twenty years), I have taken
Charley into "All the Year Round." He is a very good
man of business, and evinces considerable aptitude in sub-editing
work.</p>

<p>This place is immensely improved since you were here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
and really is now very pretty indeed. We are sorry that
there is no present prospect of your coming to see it; but I
like to know of your being at the sea, and having to do&mdash;<i>from

<p>I dined at Greenwich a few days ago with Delane. He
asked me about you with much interest. He looks as if he
had never seen a printing-office, and had never been out of
bed after midnight.</p>

<p>I send you the second chapter of the remarkable

have no doubt there are some verbal mistakes in it. However,
they will probably express themselves.</p>

<p>But I offer a prize of six pairs of gloves&mdash;between you,
and your aunt, and Ellen Stone, as competitors&mdash;to whomsoever
will tell me what idea in this second part is mine. I
don't mean an idea in language, in the turning of a sentence,
in any little description of an action, or a gesture, or
what not in a small way, but an idea, distinctly affecting the
whole story <i>as I found it</i>. You are all to assume that I
found it in the main as you read it, with one exception. If
I had written it, I should have made the woman love the
man at last. And I should have shadowed that possibility
out, by the child's bringing them a little more together on
that holiday Sunday.</p>

<p>But I didn't write it. So, finding that it wanted something,
I put that something in. What was it?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter.</p>

<p>I have very strong opinions on the subject of speechification,
and hold that there is, everywhere, a vast amount
too much of it. A sense of absurdity would be so strong
upon me, if I got up at Birmingham to make a flourish on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the advantages of education in the abstract for all sorts
and conditions of men, that I should inevitably check
myself and present a surprising incarnation of the soul of
wit. But if I could interest myself in the practical usefulness
of the particular institution; in the ways of life of
the students; in their examples of perseverance and determination
to get on; in their numbers, their favourite studies,
the number of hours they must daily give to the work that
must be done for a livelihood, before they can devote
themselves to the acquisition of new knowledge, and so
forth, then I could interest others. This is the kind of
information I want. Mere holding forth "I utterly detest,
abominate, and abjure."</p>

<p>I fear I shall not be in London next week. But if you
will kindly send me here, at your leisure, the roughest
notes of such points as I have indicated, I shall be heartily
obliged to you, and will take care of their falling into shape
and order in my mind. Meantime I "make a note of"
Monday, 27th September, and of writing to you touching
your kind offer of hospitality, three weeks before that date.</p>

kind offer of hospitality when I come to Birmingham for
<i>our</i> Institution. I must come down in time for a quiet

Dolby, and must away next morning. Besides having a
great deal in hand just now (the title of a new book among
other things), I shall have visitors from abroad here at the
time, and am severely claimed by my daughter, who indeed
is disloyal to Birmingham in the matter of my going away
at all. Pray represent me to Mrs. Ryland as the innocent
victim of circumstances, and as sacrificing pleasure to the
work I have to do, and to the training under which alone I
can do it without feeling it.</p>

<p>You will see from the enclosed that I am in full force,
and going to finish my readings, please God, after Christmas.
I am in the hope of receiving your promised notes
in due course, and continue in the irreverent condition in
which I last reported myself on the subject of speech-making.
Now that men not only make the nights of the
session hideous by what the Americans call "orating" in
Parliament, but trouble the peace of the vacation by saying
over again what they said there (with the addition of what
they <i>didn't</i> say there, and never will have the courage to
say there), I feel indeed that silence, like gold across the

<p>I duly received your letter nearly a fortnight ago,
with the greatest interest and pleasure. Above all things I

<p>This leaves me in the preliminary agonies of a new

not twenty) next March. The coming readings being all

scarcely inconvenience, even, so long as he is idle. That
he likes idleness exceedingly. He has bought a country

<p>Ryland of Birmingham doesn't look a day older, and
was full of interest in you, and asked me to remind you of

tea-urns from a railway station (Stafford), sent there to be

and had been supplying the passengers, under the active

<h2>1870.</h2>

<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Charles Dickens</span> passed his last Christmas and New Year's
Day at Gad's Hill, with a party of family and friends, in the
usual way, except that he was suffering again from an
attack of the foot trouble, particularly on Christmas Day,
when he was quite disabled by it and unable to walk at
all&mdash;able only to join the party in the evening by keeping
his room all day. However, he was better in a day or two,
and early in January he went to London, where he had
taken the house of his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Milner Gibson,
for the season.</div>

<p>His series of "Farewell Readings" at St. James's Hall
began in January, and ended on the 16th March. He was
writing "Edwin Drood" also, and was, of course, constantly
occupied with "All the Year Round" work. In the beginning
of January, he fulfilled his promise of paying a second
visit to Birmingham and making a speech, of which he
writes in his last letter to Mr. Macready.</p>

<p>For his last reading he gave the "Christmas Carol" and
"The Trial" from "Pickwick," and at the end of the evening
he addressed a few farewell words to his audience. It was a
memorable and splendid occasion. He was very deeply
affected by the loving enthusiasm of his greeting, and it
was a real sorrow to him to give up for ever the personal
associations with thousands of the readers of his books.
But when the pain, mingled with pleasure, of this last reading
was over, he felt greatly the relief of having undisturbed
time for his own quieter pursuits, and looked forward to
writing the last numbers of "Edwin Drood" at Gad's Hill,
where he was to return in June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>The last public appearance of any kind that he made
was at the Royal Academy dinner in May. He was at the
time far from well, but he made a great effort to be present
and to speak, from his strong desire to pay a tribute to
the memory of his dear old friend Mr. Maclise, who died
in April.</p>

<p>Her Majesty having expressed a wish, conveyed through
Mr. Helps (afterwards Sir Arthur Helps), to have a personal
interview with Charles Dickens, he accompanied Mr. Helps
to Buckingham Palace one afternoon in March. He was
most graciously and kindly received by her Majesty, and
came away with a hope that the visit had been mutually
agreeable. The Queen presented him with a copy of her
"Journal in the Highlands," with an autograph inscription.
And he had afterwards the pleasure of requesting her
acceptance of a set of his books. He attended a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'levee'">lev&eacute;e</ins> held
by the Prince of Wales in April, and the last time he dined
out in London was at a party given by Lord Houghton for
the King of the Belgians and the Prince of Wales, who had
both expressed a desire to meet Charles Dickens. All
through the season he had been suffering, at intervals, from
the swollen foot, and on this occasion it was so bad, that up
to the last moment it was very doubtful whether he could
fulfil his engagement.</p>

<p>We have very few letters for this year, and none of any
very particular interest, but we give them all, as they are
<i>the last</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. S. L. Fildes was his "new illustrator," to whom he
alludes in a note to Mr. Frith; we also give a short note to
Mr. Fildes himself.</p>

<p>The correspondence of Charles Dickens with Mrs.
Dallas Glyn, the celebrated actress, for whom he had a
great friendship, is so much on the subject of her own
business, that we have only been able to select two notes
of any public interest.</p>

<p>In explanation of <i>the last letter</i>, we give an extract from
a letter addressed to <i>The Daily News</i> by Mr. J. M. Makeham,
soon after the death of Charles Dickens, as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
"That the public may exactly understand the circumstances
under which Charles Dickens's letter to me was written, I
am bound to explain that it is in reply to a letter which I
addressed to him in reference to a passage in the tenth
chapter of "Edwin Drood," respecting which I ventured to
suggest that he had, perhaps, forgotten that the figure of
speech alluded to by him, in a way which, to my certain
knowledge, was distasteful to some of his admirers, was
drawn from a passage of Holy Writ which is greatly
reverenced by a large number of his countrymen as a
prophetic description of the sufferings of our Saviour."</p>

<p>The MS. of the little "History of the New Testament"
is now in the possession of his eldest daughter. She has
(together with her aunt) received many earnest entreaties,
both from friends and strangers, that this history might
be allowed to be published, for the benefit of other
children.</p>

<p>These many petitions have his daughter's fullest sympathy.
But she knows that her father wrote this history
<span class="smcap">only</span> for his own children, that it was his particular wish
that it never should be published, and she therefore holds
this wish as sacred and irrevocable.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Wills</span>,</div>

<p>In the note I had from you about Nancy and Sikes,
you seem to refer to some other note you had written me.
Therefore I think it well merely to mention that I have
received no other note.</p>

<p>I do not wonder at your not being up to the undertaking
(even if you had had no cough) under the wearing
circumstances. It was a very curious scene. The actors
and actresses (most of the latter looking very pretty)
mustered in extraordinary force, and were a fine audience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
I set myself to carrying out of themselves and their observation,
those who were bent on watching how the effects
were got; and I believe I succeeded. Coming back to it
again, however, I feel it was madness ever to do it so continuously.
My ordinary pulse is seventy-two, and it runs
up under this effort to one hundred and twelve. Besides
which, it takes me ten or twelve minutes to get my wind
back at all; I being, in the meantime, like the man who
lost the fight&mdash;in fact, his express image. Frank Beard was
in attendance to make divers experiments to report to
Watson; and although, as you know, he stopped it instantly
when he found me at Preston, he was very much astonished
by the effects of the reading on the reader.</p>

<p>So I hope you may be able to come and hear it before it
is silent for ever. It is done again on the evenings of the
1st February, 15th February, and 8th March. I hope, now
I have got over the mornings, that I may be able to work
on my book. But up to this time the great preparation
required in getting the subjects up again, and the twice
a week besides, have almost exclusively occupied me.</p>

<p>I have something the matter with my right thumb, and
can't (as you see) write plainly. I sent a word to poor
Robert Chambers,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and I send my love to Mrs. Wills.</p>

<p>You make me very uneasy on the subject of your
new long story here, by sowing your name broadcast in so
many fields at once, and undertaking such an impossible
amount of fiction at one time. Just as you are coming on
with us, you have another story in progress in "The
Gentleman's Magazine," and another announced in "Once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
a Week." And so far as I know the art we both profess,
it cannot be reasonably pursued in this way. I think the
short story you are now finishing in these pages obviously
marked by traces of great haste and small consideration;
and a long story similarly blemished would really do the
publication irreparable harm.</p>

<p>These considerations are so much upon my mind that I
cannot forbear representing them to you, in the hope that
they may induce you to take a little more into account the
necessity of care and preparation, and some self-denial in
the quantity done. I am quite sure that I write fully as

<p>Your next Tuesday's subject is a very good one. I
would not lose the point that narrow-minded fanatics, who
decry the theatre and defame its artists, are absolutely the
advocates of depraved and barbarous amusements. For
wherever a good drama and a well-regulated theatre decline,
some distorted form of theatrical entertainment will infallibly
arise in their place. In one of the last chapters of "Hard
Times," Mr. Sleary says something to the effect: "People
will be entertained thomehow, thquire. Make the betht of

<p>All through this spring in London, Charles Dickens had
been ailing in health, and it was remarked by many friends
that he had a weary look, and was "aged" and altered.
But he was generally in good spirits, and his family had no
uneasiness about him, relying upon the country quiet and
comparative rest at Gad's Hill to have their usual influence
in restoring his health and strength. On the 2nd June he
attended a private play at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Freake,
where his two daughters were among the actresses. The
next day he went back to Gad's Hill. His daughter Kate
(whose home was there at all times when she chose, and
almost always through the summer months) went down on
Sunday, the 5th June, for a day's visit, to see the "great
improvement of the conservatory." Her father laughingly
assured her she had now seen "the last" improvement at
Gad's Hill. At this time he was tolerably well, but she
remarked to her sister and aunt how strangely he was tired,
and what a curious grey colour he had in his face after a
very short walk on that Sunday afternoon. However, he
seemed quite himself again in the evening. The next day
his daughter Kate went back, accompanied by her sister,
who was to pay her a short visit, to London.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens was very hard at work on the sixth
number of "Edwin Drood." On the Monday and Tuesday
he was well, but he was unequal to much exercise. His last
walk was one of his greatest favourites&mdash;through Cobham
Park and Wood&mdash;on the afternoon of Tuesday.</p>

<p>On the morning of Wednesday, the 8th (one of the
loveliest days of a lovely summer), he was very well; in
excellent spirits about his book, of which he said he <i>must</i>
finish his number that day&mdash;the next (Thursday) being the
day of his weekly visit to "All the Year Round" office.
Therefore, he would write all day in the Ch&acirc;let, and take
no walk or drive until the evening. In the middle of the
day he came to the house for an hour's rest, and smoked a
cigar in the conservatory&mdash;out of which new addition to the
house he was taking the greatest personal enjoyment&mdash;and
seemed perfectly well, and exceedingly cheerful and hopeful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
When he came again to the house, about an hour before the
time fixed for the early dinner, he seemed very tired, silent,
and absorbed. But this was so usual with him after a day
of engrossing work, that it caused no alarm or surprise to
his sister-in-law&mdash;the only member of his household who
happened to be at home. He wrote some letters&mdash;among
them, these last letters which we give&mdash;in the library of the
house, and also arranged many trifling business matters,
with a view to his departure for London the next morning.
He was to be accompanied, on his return at the end of the
week, by Mr. Fildes, to introduce the "new illustrator" to
the neighbourhood in which many of the scenes of this last
book of Charles Dickens, as of his first, were laid.</p>

<p>It was not until they were seated at the dinner-table
that a striking change in the colour and expression of his
face startled his sister-in-law, and on her asking him if he
was ill, he said, "Yes, very ill; I have been very ill for the
last hour." But on her expressing an intention of sending
instantly for a doctor, he stopped her, and said: "No, he
would go on with dinner, and go afterwards to London."
And then he made an effort to struggle against the fit that
was fast coming on him, and talked, but incoherently, and
soon very indistinctly. It being now evident that he <i>was</i>
ill, and very seriously ill, his sister-in-law begged him to
come to his own room before she sent off for medical
help. "Come and lie down," she entreated. "Yes, on the
ground," he said, very distinctly&mdash;these were the last words
he spoke&mdash;and he slid from her arm, and fell upon the floor.</p>

<p>The servants brought a couch into the dining-room,
where he was laid. A messenger was despatched for Mr.
Steele, the Rochester doctor, and with a telegram to his
doctor in London, and to his daughters. This was a few
minutes after six o'clock.</p>

<p>His daughters arrived, with Mr. Frank Beard, this same
evening. His eldest son the next morning, and his son
Henry and his sister Letitia in the evening of the 9th&mdash;too
late, alas!</p>

<p>All through the night, Charles Dickens never opened his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
eyes, or showed a sign of consciousness. In the afternoon
of the 9th, Dr. Russell Reynolds arrived at Gad's Hill,
having been summoned by Mr. Frank Beard to meet
himself and Mr. Steele. But he could only confirm their
hopeless verdict, and made his opinion known with much
kind sympathy, to the family, before returning to London.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens remained in the same unconscious state
until the evening of this day, when, at ten minutes past six,
the watchers saw a shudder pass over him, heard him give
a deep sigh, saw one tear roll down his cheek, and he was
gone from them. And as they saw the dark shadow steal
across his calm, beautiful face, not one among them&mdash;could
they have been given such a power&mdash;would have recalled
his sweet spirit back to earth.</p>

<p>As his family were aware that Charles Dickens had
a wish to be buried near Gad's Hill, arrangements were
made for his burial in the pretty churchyard of Shorne, a
neighbouring village, of which he was very fond. But
this intention was abandoned in consequence of a pressing
request from the Dean and Chapter of Rochester Cathedral
that his remains might be placed there. A grave was prepared
and everything arranged, when it was made known
to the family, through Dean Stanley, that there was a
general and very earnest desire that Charles Dickens should
find his resting-place in Westminster Abbey. To such a
fitting tribute to his memory they could make no possible
objection, although it was with great regret that they relinquished
the idea of laying him in a place so closely
identified with his life and his works. His name, notwithstanding,
is associated with Rochester, a tablet to his
memory having been placed by his executors on the wall
of Rochester Cathedral.</p>

<p>With regard to Westminster Abbey, his family only
stipulated that the funeral might be made as private as
possible, and that the words of his will, "I emphatically
direct that I be buried in an inexpensive, unostentatious,
and strictly private manner," should be religiously adhered
to. And so they were. The solemn service in the vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
cathedral being as private as the most thoughtful consideration
could make it.</p>

<p>The family of Charles Dickens were deeply grateful to
all in authority who so carried out his wishes. And more
especially to Dean Stanley and to the (late) Lady Augusta
Stanley, for the tender sympathy shown by them to the
mourners on this day, and also on Sunday, the 19th, when
the Dean preached his beautiful funeral sermon.</p>

<p>As during his life Charles Dickens's fondness for air,
light, and gay colours amounted almost to a passion, so when
he lay dead in the home he had so dearly loved, these things
were not forgotten.</p>

<p>The pretty room opening into the conservatory (from
which he had never been removed since his seizure) was
kept bright with the most beautiful of all kinds of flowers,
and flooded with the summer sun:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And nothing stirred in the room. The old, old fashion. The
fashion that came in with our first garments, and will last unchanged
